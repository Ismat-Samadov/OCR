JAFFAR, the 13armeeide, the good Vizier,

The poor man's hope, the friend without a peer,
Jaltar was dead, slain by a doom unjust:

And guilty Haroun, sullen with mistrust s

Of what the good and e'en the bad might say,
Ordained that no man living from that day
Should dare to speak his name on pain of death —
All Araby and Persia held their breath.

All but the brave Mondeer.—He, proud to show |
How far for love a grateful soul could go,
And facing death for very scorn and grief,
(For his great heart wanted a great relief),
Stood forth in Bagdad, daily in the square
Where once had stood a happy house, and there
Harangued the tremblers at the seymitar,
On all they owed to the divine Jaffar.

Was brought—was gazed upon. The mutes began
To bind his arms. "Welcome, brave cords," cried he;
"From bonds far worse Jaffir delivered me;

However, he persisted cheerfully and pleaded, "Please then, let me be remembered as one who loves his fellow men."

The angel took note and disappeared. The following night it returned, bringing a great awakening light. It displayed the names of those whom love for God had blessed, and lo, Ben Adhem's name led all the rest.

LEIGH HUNT

JAFFAR

Jaffar, the Barmecide, the noble Vizier, was a beacon of hope for the poor and an unparalleled friend. Jaffar met an untimely end, slaughtered by a wrongful fate.

Guilty Haroun, plagued by distrust over the potential talk of both well-intentioned and malicious individuals, decreed that from that day forward, none would dare to utter Jaffar's name upon the threat of death. Every breath across Arabia and Persia was held painfully still.

However, one individual dared to defy—brave Mondeer. Driven by a need to express the gratitude he held in his heart, Mondeer rose up in Baghdad every day at the very public square. Once, a happy house proudly stood there, but all that remained was a reminder of Jaffar's divine deeds.

"Bring me this man," ordered the caliph. The man was brought forward and bound by the caliph's servants. He welcomed the restraints, declaring, "These ties are welcome, for from far worse shackles, Jaffar once freed me."

FOUR POEMS 68

From wants, from shames, from loveless household fears;
Made a man's eyes friends with delicious tears;
Restored me, loved me, put me on a par

With his great self. How can I pay Jane?"

Hamm, who felt that on a soul like this
The mightiest vengeance could but fall amiss,
Now deigned to smile, as one great lord of fate
Might smile upon another half as great.

Ie said, "Let worth grow frenzied, if it will;
The caliph's judgment shall ble master still.
Go: and since gifts so move thee, take this gem,
The richest in the Tartar's diadem,

And hold the giver as thou dcemest fit."

" Gifts I" cried the friend. He took; and holding it
High towards the heavens, as though to meet his star,
Exclaimed, "This too I owe to thee, Jan.'s."

They made a man's eyes friends with delightful tears;
They comforted me, adored me, considered me equal

To his great persona. How can I repay Jane?

Hamm, who recognized that even the strongest retribution could barely affect a soul like this,
Now chose to smile, as one influential force of destiny
Might smile upon another that's half as influential.

He said, "Let virtue grow frenzied, if it will;
The caliph's judgment will persist to be dominant.
Go, and since you're so swayed by gifts, accept this jewel,
The most valuable in the Tartar's crown,

And consider the giver as you see fit."

"Gifts!" cried the friend. He gratefully accepted; and while holding it
High towards the heavens, as though to reach his destiny,
Exclaimed, "This too I owe to Jane."

And you, warm little housekeeper, who class
With those who think the candles come too soon,
Loving the fire, and with your tricksome tune
Nick the glad, silent moments as they pass;
Oh sweet and tiny cousins, that belong,
One to the fields, the other to the hearth,
Both have your sunshine; both, though small, are strong
At your clear hearts; and both seem given to earth
To sing in thoughtful ears this natural song—
Indoors and out, summer and winter, Mirth.

Tire poetry of earth is never dead :
When all the birds are faint with the hot sun,
And hide in cooling trees, a voice will run
From hedge to hedge about the new-mown mead:
That is the grasshopper's—he takes the lead
In summer luxury,—he has never done
With his delights, for when tired out with fun,
He rests at ease beneath some pleasant weed.
The poetry of earth is ceasing never:
On a lone winter evening, when the frost
Has wrought a silence, from the hearth there shrills
The cricket's song, in warmth increasing ever,
And seems, to one in drowsiness half lost,
The grasshopper's among some grassy hills.

You, warm little domestic, who aligns
With those who think the candles light too early,
Cherishing the fire, and with your playful melody
Mark the joyful, silent moments as they go by;
Oh sweet and tiny kin, that belong,
One to the fields, the other to the home,
Both possess your sunshine; both, though small, are resilient
At your pure hearts; and both seem destined for the earth
To sing in reflective minds this innate song—
Inside and outside, in summer and winter, Joy.

The poetry of earth is never silent :
When all the birds are weary with the blazing sun,
And seek solace in cooling trees, a sound will echo
From boundary to boundary of the fresh-mowed meadow:
That is the grasshopper's—he takes the forefront
In summer indulgence,—he never tires
Of his activities, for when exhausted from enjoyment,
He rests at ease beneath some comforting plant.
The poetry of earth never ceases:
On a solitary winter evening, when the frost
Has created a silence, from the fireplace there resonates
The cricket's song, with warmth that increases,
And seems, to one in semi slumber,
The grasshopper's voice among some grassy hills.

AN EQUESTRIAN ADVENTURE

MR PICKWICK found that his three companions liad risen,
and were waiting his arrival to commence breakfast,
which was ready laid in tempting display. They sat
down to the meal; and broiled ham, eggs, tea, coffee,
and sundries, began to disappear with a rapidity which
at once bore testimony to the excellence of the fare, and
the appetites of its consumers:

"Now, about Manor Farm," said Mr Pickwick. "How
shall we go ?"

"We had better consult the waiter, perhaps," said Mr
Tupman, and the waiter was summoned accordingly.

"Dingley Dell, gentlemen—fifteen miles, gentlemen—
cross road—post-chaise, sir?"

"Post-chaise won't hold more than two," said Mr
Pickwick.

"True, sir—beg your pardon, sit —Very nice four-
wheeled chaise, sir—seat for two behind—one in front
for the gentleman that drives —oh! beg your pardon, sir —
that'll only hold three."

"What's to be done ?" said Mr Snodgrass.

"Perhaps one of the gentlemen would like to ride,
sir?" suggested the waiter, looking towards Mr Winkle;
"very good saddle horses, sir--any of Mr Wardle's men
coming to Rochester bring 'cm back, sir."

"The very thing,” said Mr Pickwick. "Winkle, will

you go on horseback?" 6)

AN EQUESTRIAN ADVENTURE

Mr. Pickwick discovered that his three companions had already risen and were waiting for him to arrive to start breakfast, which was tastefully prepared and ready. They sat down to enjoy the meal; broiled ham, eggs, tea, coffee, and other items began to vanish swiftly, demonstrating not only the quality and appeal of the food but the appetite of those consuming it. 

"Now, about Manor Farm," initiated Mr. Pickwick. "How shall we get there?"

"Perhaps we should consult the waiter," suggested Mr. Tupman, and the waiter was called forthwith.

"Dingley Dell, gentlemen—fifteen miles, gentlemen—cross road—post-chaise, sir?" proposed the waiter.

"A post-chaise can't hold more than two," responded Mr. Pickwick.

"Indeed, sir—I apologize, sir." The waiter reassessed. "We have a lovely four-wheeled chaise, sir—space for two in the back—one up front for the gentleman who drives. My apologies again, sir—only three can be accommodated."

"What's the solution?" asked Mr. Snodgrass.

"Perhaps one of the gentlemen would consider riding a horse, sir?" The waiter suggested, eyeing Mr. Winkle. "We've fine saddle horses, sir. Any of Mr. Wardle's men going to Rochester can return them, sir."

"Perfect," exclaimed Mr. Pickwick. "Winkle, would you agree to ride horseback?"

EXTRACTS AND EXERCISES

Mr Winkle did entertain considerable misgivings in the
very lowest recesses of his own heart, relative to his
equestrian skill; but, as he would not have them even
suspected on any account, he at once replied with
great hardihood, "Certainly. I should enjoy it, of all
things."

Mr Winkle had rushed upon his fate; there was no
resource. "Let them be at the door by eleven," said
Mr Pickwick.

"Very well, sir," replied the waiter.

The waiter retired; the breakfast concluded: and the
travellers ascended to their respective bedrooms, to pre-
pare a change of clothing, to take with them on their
approaching expedition,

Mr Pickwick had made his preliminary arrangements,
and was looking over the coffee-room blinds at the
passengers in the street, when the waiter entered, and
announced that the chaise was ready—an announcement
which the vehicle itself confirmed, by forthwith appear-
ing before the coffee-room blinds aforesaid.

It was a curious little green box on four wheels, with
a low place liken wine-bin for two behind, andan elevated
perch for one in front,drawn by an immense brown horse,
displaying great symmetry of bone. An hostler stood
near, bolding by the bridle another immense horse—
apparently a near relative of the animal in the chaise—
ready saddled for Mr Winkle.

"Bless. my soul!" said Mr Pickwick, as they stood upon
the pavement while the coats were being put in. "Bless
my soul! who's to drive? I never thought of that."

"Ohl you, of course," said Mr Tupinan.

"I" exclaimed Mr Pickwick.

"Not the slightest fear, sir," interposed the hostler.|

EXTRACTS AND EXERCISES

Mr. Winkle did harbor considerable doubts deep within his heart about his equestrian skills. However, he did not want these doubts to be suspected by others, thus he promptly responded with confidence, "Certainly, I would enjoy that immensely."

Mr. Winkle had sealed his fate - there was no turning back. "Let them be ready at the door by eleven," Mr. Pickwick instructed.

"Very well, sir," responded the waiter.

The waiter excused himself and after concluding breakfast, the travelers retired to their individual rooms to prepare and gather a change of clothes for the upcoming endeavor.

Mr. Pickwick had made the preliminary arrangements and was peering through the coffee-room blinds at the bustling street when the waiter returned to announce the chaise was ready, a fact simultaneously confirmed by the arrival of said vehicle in front of the very coffee-room blinds Mr. Pickwick was observing through.

The vehicle was a quaint green four-wheeled box with a low seating area for two at the back and an elevated single seat at the front. It was pulled by a huge brown horse with strikingly symmetrical build. Nearby stood a stable hand, holding the reins of another massive horse, seemingly the companion to the one hitched to the chaise, already saddled for Mr. Winkle.

"Bless my soul!" Mr. Pickwick exclaimed, standing on the pavement as their coats were loaded into the vehicle. "Bless my soul! Who's going to drive? I hadn't thought of that."

"Oh! You, of course," Mr. Tupman suggested.

"I?" cried Mr. Pickwick in surprise.

"Not the slightest fear, sir," the stable hand reassured him.

"He don't shy, does he?" inquired Mr Pickwick.

"Shy, sir?—lie wouldn't shy if he was to meet a
vaggin-load of monkeys with their tails burnt off."

The last recommendation was indisputable. Mr Tup-
man and Mr Snodgrass got into the bin; Mr Pickwick
ascended to his perch, and deposited his feet on a floor-
clothed shelf, erected beneath it for that purpose.

"Now, shiny Villiam," said the hostler to the deputy
hostler, "give the gen'Im'n the ribbius." "Shiny
Villiam "—so called, probably, from his sleek hair and
oily countenance—placed the reins in Mr Pickwick's left
hand; and the upper hostler thrust a whip into his right.

"Wo-ol" cried Mr Pickwick, as the tall quadruped
evinced a decided inclination to back into the coffee-room
window.

"tiro-o!" echoed Mr Tupman and Mr Snodgrass from
the bin.

"Only his playfulness, gcn'lm'n," said the head hostler
encouragingly; "just kitch hold on him, Villiam." The
deputy restrained the animal's impetuosity, and the
principal ran to assist Mr Winkle in mounting.

"Tother side, sir, if you please."

"Mowed if the gen'lm'n worn't a gettin' up on the
wrong side," whispered a grinning post-boy to the in-
expressibly gratified waiter.

Mr Winkle, thus instructed, climbed into his saddle,
with about as much ,,difficulty as he would have ex-
perienced in getting up the side of a first-rate man-of-war.

"All right?" inquired Mr Pickwick, with an inward
pre \ rid iment that it was all wrong.

"All right," replied Mr Winkle faintly.

"Keep him calm, sir; even an infant could lead him," came the reply.

"Does he shy often?" Mr. Pickwick inquired.

"Shy, sir? He wouldn't even shy if he encountered a wagon load of monkeys with their tails burnt off."

The final recommendation appeared indisputable. Mr. Tupman and Mr. Snodgrass climbed into the bin while Mr. Pickwick ascended to his perch, settling his feet on a floor-clothed shelf built specifically for that reason.

"Now, Shiny William," the hostler instructed the deputy hostler, "give the gentlemen the reins." Shiny William, named probably due to his glossy hair and greasy face, handed the reins over to Mr. Pickwick's left hand and the head hostler slid a whip into his right.

"Whoa!" Mr. Pickwick exclaimed as the tall quadruped showed a clear tendency to back into the coffee-room window.

"Whoa!" Mr. Tupman and Mr. Snodgrass echoed from the bin.

"Just his playful nature, gentlemen," the head hostler reassured, "Hold him steady, William." The deputy managed to control the animal's enthusiasm while the head hostler ran to assist Mr. Winkle in mounting.

"Other side, sir, if you please."

"Wouldn't believe it if the gentleman wasn't trying to mount from the wrong side," a snickering post-boy whispered to a thoroughly amused waiter.

With these instructions, Mr. Winkle navigated into his saddle with about the same level of difficulty as scaling the side of a first-rate man-of-war.

"Is everything alright?" Mr. Pickwick asked, feeling deep within that everything was far from alright.

"All right," Mr. Winkle replied faintly.

"Let 'em go," cried the hostler.—"Hold him in, sir,"
and away went the chaise, and the saddle-horse, with Mr
Pickwick on the box of the one, and Mr Winkle on the
back of the other, to the delight and gratification of the
whole inn-yard.

"What makes him go sideways?" said Mr Snodgrass
in the bin, to Mr Winkle in the saddle.

"I can't imagine," replied Mr Winkle. His horse was
drifting up the street in the most mysterious manner—
side first, with his head towards one side of the way, and
his tail towards the other.

Mr Pickwick had no leisure to observe either this or
any other particular, the whole of his faculties being
concentrated in the management of the animal attached
to the chaise, who displayed various peculiarities, highly
interesting to a bystander, but by no means equally
amusing to anyone seated behind him. Besides con-
stantly jerking his head up, in a very unpleasant and
uncomfortable manner, and tugging at the reins to an
extent which rendered it a matter of great difficulty for
Mr Pickwick to hold them, he had a singular propensity
for darting suddenly every now and then to the side of
the road, then stopping short, and then rushing forward
for some minutes, at a speed which it was wholly im-
possible to control.

"What can he mean by this?" said Mr Snodgrass,
when the horse had executed this manoeuvre for the
twentieth time.

"T don't know," replied Mr Tupman: "it /Jooks very

"What makes him go sideways?" Mr. Snodgrass inquired from the bin, addressing Mr. Winkle in the saddle. 

"I can't imagine," replied Mr. Winkle. His horse was oddly drifting up the street — side first, its head directed towards one side of the street, and its tail pointed to the other. 

Mr. Pickwick had no leisure to observe this peculiar behavior, or any other detail. All his faculties were concentrated on controlling his own steed. The animal was behaving oddly — displaying a number of unusual actions which were certainly interesting to bystanders but hardly amusing to Mr. Pickwick seated behind him. 

In addition to persistently jerking its head upwards in a most uncomfortable manner and pulling the reins to an extent that made it difficult for Mr. Pickwick to hold them, the horse had a strange penchant for darting suddenly to the side of the road, stopping abruptly, and then rushing forth for several minutes at a speed which was completely impossible to manage. 

"What does he mean by this?" Mr. Snodgrass queried after the horse had performed this strange maneuver for the twentieth time. 

"I don't know," Mr. Tupman responded. "It looks very much like shying, doesn't it?" Mr. Snodgrass was about to reply when a shout from Mr. Pickwick interrupted him. 

"Look," communicated the man. "I have dropped my whip."

"Winkle," said Mr Snodgrass, as the equestrian came
trotting up on the tall horse, with his hat over his ears,
and shaking all over, as if he would shake to pieces, with
the violence of the exercise, " pick up the whip, there's
a good fellow."

Mr Winkle pulled at the bridle of the tall horse till he
was black in the face; and having at length succeeded
in stopping him, dismounted, handed the whip to Mr
Pickwick, and grasping the reins, prepared to remount.

Now whether the tall horse, in the natural playfulness
of his disposition, was desirous of having a little innocent
recreation with Mr Winkle, or whether it occurred to him
that he could perform the journey as much to his own
satisfaction without a rider as with one, are points upon
which, of course, we can arrive at no definite and distinct
conclusion. By whatever motives the animal was
actuated, certain it is that Mr Winkle had no sooner
touched the reins, than he slipped them over his head,
and darted backwards to their full length.

"Poor fellow," said Mr Winkle soothingly" poor
fellow—good old horse." The "poor fellow" was proof
against flattery: the more Mr Winkle tried to get near
him, the more he sidled away; and, notwithstanding all
kinds of coaxing and wheedling, there were Mr Winkle
and the horse going round and round each other for ten
minutes, at the end of which time each was at precisely
the same distance from the other as when they first
commenced—an unsatisfactory state of things under any
circumstances, but particularly so in a lonely road, where
no assistance can be procured.

"What am I to do?" shouted Mr Winkle, after the
dodging had been prolonged for a considerable time.
"What am Ito do? I can't get on him."

"Winkle," Mr. Snodgrass called out as the equestrian trotted up on his tall horse, his hat covering his ears. Winkle was trembling uncontrollably from the strenuous activity, looking like he could fall apart at any moment. "Could you pick up the whip for me?" he asked.

Straining his face to a crimson hue, Mr. Winkle struggled with the tall horse's bridle until he managed to halt the creature. Once the horse had stopped, he dismounted, handed the whip over to Mr. Pickwick, and then, with reins in hand, prepared to climb back onto the horse.

It was unclear whether the tall horse, perhaps due to its naturally playful temperament, sought some harmless amusement at Mr. Winkle's expense, or simply preferred to undertake this journey unburdened by a rider. In any case, the moment Mr. Winkle touched the reins, the horse slyly slid them over its head and retreated.

"Poor fellow," Mr. Winkle cooed sympathetically, "good old horse." His flattery, however, fell on indifferent ears, the "poor fellow" being immune to it. The more Mr. Winkle attempted to approach the horse, the more the animal sidestepped him. Despite all manner of coaxing and cajoling, the standoff between Mr. Winkle and the horse continued in a circular dance for a good ten minutes, at the end of which both were precisely the same distance apart as when they had begun. Not a satisfactory state of affairs at any time, but particularly so on a lonely road where no help was forthcoming.

"What am I to do?" Mr. Winkle shouted in frustration after a considerable passage of time. "How am I supposed to get on him?"

"You had better lead him till we come to a turnpike,"
replied Mr Pickwick from the chaise.

"But he won't comet" roared Mr Winkle. "Do come,
and hold him."

Mr Pickwick was the very personation of kindness and
humanity: he threw the reins on the horse's back, and
having descended from his scat, carefully drew the chaise
into the hedge, lest anything should come along the road,
and stepped back to the assistance of his distressed
companion, leaving Mr Tupman and Mr Snodgrass in
the vehicle.

The horse no sooner beheld Mr Pickwick advancing
towards him with the chaise whip in his hand, than he
exchanged the rotatory motion in which he had pre-
viously indulged, for a retrograde movement of so very
determined a character, that it at once drew Mr Winkle,
who was still at the end of the bridle, at a rather quicker
rate than fast walking, in the direction from which they
had just come. Mr Pickwick ran to his assistance, but
the faster Mr Pickwick ran forward, the faster the horse
ran backward. There was a great scraping of feet, and
kicking up of the dust; and at last Mr Winkle, his arms
being nearly pulled out of their sockets, fairly let go his
hold. The horse paused, stared, shook his head, turned
round, and quietly trotted home to Rochester, leaving
Mr Winkle and Mr Pickwick gazing on each other with
countenances of blank dismay. A rattling noise at a little
distance attracted their attention. They looked up.

"Bless my soul!" exclaimed the agonized Mr Pick-
wick, "there's the other horse running away!"

It was but too true. The animal was startled by the
noise, and the reins were on his back. The result may
be guessed. He tore off with the four-wheeled chaise

Mr. Pickwick embodied kindness and humanity. He cast the reins onto the horse's back. Then, he carefully disembarked from his seat and pulled the chaise into the nearby hedge to avoid any roadside disruptions. He then moved back to assist his distressed companion, leaving Mr. Tupman and Mr. Snodgrass in the vehicle.

As soon as the horse saw Mr. Pickwick approaching with a chaise whip in hand, he switched his spinning motion for a determined retreat. This abrupt shift caused Mr. Winkle, still holding the bridle, to follow at more than a walking pace in the opposite direction. Mr. Pickwick tried to assist, but the more he advanced, the more the horse retreated. It resulted in great scraping of feet and whirling of dust. Eventually, the strain on Mr Winkle's arms forced him to release his grip. The horse paused, gave a bewildered look, shook his head, and casually trotted back towards Rochester, leaving Mr. Winkle and Mr. Pickwick staring at each other in disbelief. A clattering noise at a distance caught their attention, and they looked up.

"Heavens, the other horse is running away!" exclaimed a horrified Mr. Pickwick.

Unfortunately, he was correct. The second horse, startled by the noise and with reins lying loose on its back, bolted with the four-wheeled chaise.

behind him, and Mr Tupman and Mr Snodgrass in the
four-wheeled chaise. The heat was a short one. Mr Tup-
man threw himself into the hedge, Mr Snodgrass followed
his example, the horse dashed the four-wheeled chaise
against a wooden bridge, separated the wheels from the
body, and the bin from the perch; and finally stood stock
still to gaze on the ruin lie had made.

The first care of the two unspilt friends was to extricate
their unfortunate companions from their bed of quick-
set—a process which gave them the unspeakable satis-
faction of discovering that they had sustained no injury,
beyond sundry rents in their garments, and various
lacerations from the brambles. The next thing to be done
was, to unharness the horse. This complicated process
having been effected, the party walked slowly forward,
leading the horse among them, and abandoning the chaise

to its fate. OM/ILES DICKENS, The Piclacick Papers

EXERCISES
(A) THE USE OF WORDS

Rewrite this passage, avoiding any awkward repetition by the
use of pronouns :

Mr Pickwick had no leisure to observe either this or any
other particular, the whole of Mr Pickwick's faculties being
concentrated in the management of the animal attached to
the chaise, who displayed various peculiarities highly interest-
ing to a bystander but by no means equally amusing to any
one seated behind the animal. Besides constantly jerking the
animal's head up in a very unpleasant and uncomfortable
manner, and tugging at the reins to an extent which rendered
it a matter of great difficulty for Mr Pickwick to hold the reins,
the animal had a singular propensity for darting suddenly to
the side, then stopping short and then rushing forward at a
great speed.

EQUESTRIAN ADVENTURE 78

Mr. Tupman and Mr. Snodgrass followed him in the four-wheeled chaise. The ride was brief. Mr. Tupman hurled himself into the hedge, promptly imitated by Mr. Snodgrass. The horse then crashed the chaise against a wooden bridge, separating the wheels from the body and the bin from the perch. In the end, it stood utterly still, seemingly contemplating the destruction it had caused.

The first action of the two untouched friends was to help their unfortunate companions out of the hedge, which, to their immense satisfaction, revealed that, other than a few tears in their clothes and some minor scratches from the brambles, they were unharmed. The next task at hand was unharnessing the horse. Having completed this complex procedure, the group strolled on, guiding the horse along and leaving the chaise to its fate. 

EXERCISES
(A) THE USE OF WORDS

Rewrite the following passage, avoiding awkward repetition by utilizing pronouns:

Overwhelmed by the task at hand, Mr. Pickwick had not the time to perceive his surroundings or anything specific, his focus consumed entirely by controlling the horse tethered to the chaise. To a bystander, the unusual antics of the horse would be fascinating, but to anyone seated behind the beast, these behaviors were far from entertaining. Alongside inexplicably jerking its head in an exceedingly uncomfortable manner and yanking at the reins to the point that Mr. Pickwick struggled to hold on, the horse had a peculiar habit of unexpectedly darting to the side, abruptly halting, then surging forward at high speed.

MORTE D'ARTHUR

So all day long the noise of battle roll'd

Among the mountains by the winter sea;

Until King Arthur's table, man by man,

Had fall'n in Lyonnesse about their Lord,

King Arthur: then, because his wound was deep,

The bold Sir Bedivere uplifted him,

Sir Bedivere, the last of all his knights,

And bore him to a chapel nigh the field,

A broken chancel with a broken cross,

That stood on a dark strait of barren land.

On one side lay the Ocean, and on one

Lay a great water, and the moon was full.
Then spake King Arthur to Sir Bedivere:

"The sequel of to-day unsolders all

The goodliest fellowship of famous knights

Whereof this world holds record. Such a sleep

They sleep—the men I loved. I think that we

Shall never more, at any future time,

Delight our souls with talk of knightly deeds,

Walking about the gardens and the halls

Of Camelot, as in the days that were.

I perish by this people which I made,Tho'

Merlin sware that I should come again To

rule once more—hut let what will be, be, I

am so deeply smitten thro' the helm

That without help I cannot last till morn.

THE DEATH OF ARTHUR

Throughout the day, the noise of battle rolled 

Among the mountains by the sea in winter;

Until King Arthur's knights, one by one,

Had fallen in Lyonnesse around their Lord,

King Arthur. Then, because his wound was severe,

The brave Sir Bedivere lifted him,

Sir Bedivere, the last of all his knights,

And carried him to a chapel near the battlefield,

A broken sanctuary with a damaged cross,

That stood on a bleak strip of barren land.

On one side was the Ocean, and on another,

Lay a large body of water, under the full moon.  
Then King Arthur spoke to Sir Bedivere:

"Today's aftermath unravels all 

The noblest fraternity of renowned knights 

Of which this world holds record. They sleep

The sleep—the men I loved. I believe that we 

Will never again, at any point in the future,

Delight our souls with tales of chivalrous deeds,

Wandering through the gardens and halls 

Of Camelot, as in days gone by.

I am defeated by this people whom I created, although

Merlin swore that I would return to 

Reign once more—but let what happens, happen. I 

Am so severely struck through the helmet 

That without assistance I cannot endure till dawn.

Thou therefore take my brand Excalibur,
Which was my pride: for thou rememberest how
In those old days, one summer noon, an arm
Rose up from out the bosom of the lake,
Clothed in white samite, mystic, wonderful,
Holding the sword—and how I row'd across
And took it, and have worn it, like a king:
And, wheresoever I am sung or told

Tn aftertime, this also shall be known:

But now delay not: take Excalibur,

And fling him far into the middle mere:

Watch what thou seest, and lightly bring me word."

To him replied the bold Sir Bedivere:

"It is not meet, Sir King, to leave thee thus,
Aidless, alone, and smitten thro' the helm.

A little thing may harm a wounded man.

Yet I thy hest will all perform at full,

Watch what I see, and lightly bring thee word."
So saying, from the ruin'd shrine he stept

And in the moon athwart the place of tombs,
Where lay the mighty bones of ancient men,
Old knights, and over them the sea-wind sang
Shrill, chill, with flakes of foam. He, stepping down
By zig-zag paths, and juts of pointed rock,
Came on the shining levels of the lake.

There drew he forth the brand Excalibur,
And o'er him, drawing it, the winter moon,
Brightening the skirts of a long cloud, ran forth
And sparkled keen with frost against the hilt:
For all the halt twinkled with diamond sparks,
Myriads of topaz-lights, and jacinth work '
Of subtlest jewellery. He gazed so long
That both his eyes were dazzled, as he stood,

"Take my sword, Excalibur,
Which was my pride: for you remember how
In those old days, one summer afternoon, an arm
Rose up from the heart of the lake,
Dressed in mystical and wonderful white samite,
Holding the sword. You remember how I rowed across,
Took it, and have worn it like a king.
And wherever I am celebrated or spoken of
In the future, this also shall be known.

But don't delay now: take Excalibur,
And cast it far into the middle of the lake.
Watch what you observe, and swiftly bring me news."

To him, the brave Sir Bedivere replied,
"It's not appropriate, Sir King, to leave you like this,
Helpless, alone, and struck through the helmet.
A minor thing may hurt a wounded man.
Yet I will fully execute your command,
Watch what I see, and swiftly bring you news."
So saying, he stepped away from the ruined shrine

And under the moon across the graveyard,
Where lay the strong bones of ancient men,
Old knights, and the sea-wind sang over them
Shrill, cold, with flakes of foam. He, stepping down
By zig-zag paths, and points of jagged rock,
Reached the shiny levels of the lake.

There he drew out the sword Excalibur,
And above him, illuminating it, the winter moon,
Brightening the edges of a long cloud, ran out
And shone brightly with frost against the hilt;
For the entire hilt twinkled with sparks like diamonds,
Myriads of topaz-lights, and finely detailed jacinth work.
He gazed so long
That both his eyes were dazzled as he stood.

This way and that dividing the swift mind,
In act to throw: But at the last it seem'd
Better to leave Excalibur coneeal'd

There in the many-knotted waterflags,

That whistled stiff and dry about the marge.
So strode he back slow to the wounded King.

Then spake King Arthur to Sir Bedivere:
"Nast thou performed my mission winch I gave?
What is it thou hast seen? or what hast heard?"

And answer made the bold Sir Bedivere:

"T heard the ripple washing in the reeds,
And the wild water lapping on the crag."

To whom replied King Arthur, faint and pale:
"Thou host betray'd thy nature and thy name,
Not rendering true answer, as beseem'd
Thy fealty, nor like a noble knight:

For surer sign had follow'd, either hand,

Or voice, or else a motion of the mere.

This is a shameful thing for men to lie.

Yet now, I charge thee, quickly go again

As thou art lief and dear, and do the thing

I bad thee, watch, and lightly bring me word."

Then went Sir Bedivere the second time
Across the ridge, and paced beside the mere,
Counting the dewy pebbles, rued in thought;

But when he saw the wonder of the hilt,
How curiously and strangely chased, he smote
His palms together, and he cried aloud.

"And if indeed I east the brand away,
Surely a precious thing, one worthy note,
Should thus be lost for ever from the earth,
Which might have pleased the eyes of many men.
What good should follow this, if this were done?)

Divided in thought, poised to throw, he ultimately deemed it better to leave Excalibur hidden.

Nestled in the many-knotted water reeds, 

Which whistled stalwartly at the water's edge. 

He walked back slowly to the wounded King.

Then spoke King Arthur to Sir Bedivere: 

"Have you completed the task I assigned? 

What have you observed? What news do you bring?" 

In response, the brave Sir Bedivere said: 

"I heard the ripples lapping against the reeds, 

And the wild water crashing on the crag." 

King Arthur, pale and weak, replied,

"You've betrayed your honor and your name, 

Failing to deliver the truth as befits 

Your oath of fealty, like a noble knight.

A sure sign would have followed, a hand gesture,

Or voice, or else some activity in the lake.

It is shameful for men to lie. 

Yet now, I command you, go once more, 

As you hold my favor and command, 

And do the thing I asked you, vigilantly bring me news." 

Sir Bedivere set off a second time 

Across the ridge, and walked beside the lake, 

Immersed in thought among the dewy pebbles.

But upon seeing the wonder of the hilt, 

Strangely and intricately designed, he clapped 

His hands together, and cried out. 

"And if indeed I throw the sword away, 

A thing of great value, worthy of note,

Should be lost forever from the earth, 

Which could have delighted many. 

What good would come of this, if it were done?"

What harm, undone? deep harm to disobey,
Seeing obedience is the bond of rule.

Were it well to obey then, if a king demand
An act unprofitable, against himself?

The King is sick, and knows not what he does.
What record, or what relic of my lord

Should be to aftertime, but empty breath
And rumours of a doubt? but were this kept,
Stored in some treasure house of mighty kings,
Some one might show it at a joust of arms,
Saying, 'King Arthur's sword, Exealibur,
Wrought by the lonely maiden of the Lake.
Nine years she wrought it, sitting in the deeps
Upon the hidden bases of the hills."

So might some old man speak in the aftertime
To all the people, winning, reverence.

But now much honour and much fame were lost."

So splice he, clouded with his own conceit,
And hid Exealibur the second time.

And so strode back slow to the wounded King.
Then spoke King Arthur, breathing heavily:
"What is it thou bast seen? or what had heard?"
And answer made the bold Sir Bedivere:
"T heard the water lapping on the crag,
And the long ripple washing in the reeds."

To whom replied King Arthur, much in wrath:
"Ah, miserable and unkind, untrue,
Unknightly, traitor-hearted! Woe is mel
Authority forgets a dying king,

Laid widow'd of the power in his eye

That bow'd the will. I see thee what thou art,
For thou, the latest-left of all my knights,

In whom should meet the offices of all,

What harm is there in disobedience? Significant harm, for obedience is the cornerstone of rule.

Would it still be wise to obey, then, if a king demands an unprofitable act against himself?

The King is ill and is unaware of his actions. What memory, or what remnant of my lord would exist in the future other than empty words and questionable rumors? But if kept, housed in some grand treasury of powerful kings, someone might display it at a jousting tournament, proclaiming, 'King Arthur's sword, Excalibur, crafted by the solitary maiden of the Lake. She worked on it for nine years, submerged in the depths upon the unseen foundations of the mountains."

An elder may relay this narrative in the future, garnering respect from the masses. 

Yet now, much honor and fame stand to be lost."

Thus he spoke, obscured by his conceit, and he hid Excalibur for a second time. He then slowly returned to the injured King. King Arthur, gasping for air, asked, "What have you seen, or what have you heard?" Sir Bedivere replied bravely, "I heard water lapping on the crag and the long ripple washing in the reeds."

King Arthur, consumed by rage, retorted, "Ah, you miserable, deceitful, disloyal man! Coward! Treasonous at heart! Poor me! Authority loses its hold on a dying king, robbed of the power in his gaze that once commanded the will. I see you for what you truly are. You, the last of all my knights, in whom the responsibilities of all should converge...

Valuing the giddy.pleasure of the eyes.
Yet, for a man may fail in duty twice,
And the third time may prosper, get thee hence
But, if thou spare to fling Excalibur,
I will arise and slay thee with my hands."
Then quickly rose Sir Bedivere, and ran
And, leaping down the ridges lightly, plunged

Among the bulrush-beds, and clutch'd the sword,
And strongly wheed and threw it. The great brand
Made lightnings in the splendour of the moon,
And flashing round and round, and whirl'd in an arch,
Shot like a streamer of the northern morn,
Seen where the moving isles of winter shock
By night, with noises of the northern sea.
So flash'd and fell the brand Excalibur:
But ere he dipt the surface, rose an arm
Clothed in white samite, mystic, wonderful,
And caught him by the hilt, and brandish'd him
Three times, and drew him under in the mere.
And lightly went the other to the King.

Then spake King Arthur, drawing thicker breath:
"Now see I by thine eyes that this is done.

"Sir King, I closed mine eyelids, lest the gems
Should blind my purpose, for I never saw,

You would betray me for the precious hilt;

Valuing the fleeting pleasure of the eyes.
Yet, since a man may falter in his duty twice
And the third time may succeed, depart from here.
However, if you hesitate to throw Excalibur,

Then, quickly Sir Bedivere rose and ran,
And, leaping down the ridges lightly, plunged
Into the bulrush-beds, and grasped the sword,
With a strong hand, he wheeled and threw it. The magnificent brand
Illuminated the moon's splendour with its light,
Whirling in an arch, flashing round and round, 
It looked like a beacon of the northern dawn,
Visible where the moving isles of winter collide
At night, accompanied by the sounds of the northern sea.
So Excalibur, the mighty brand, flashed and fell:
But before it touched the surface, an arm
Clothed in white samite, mystic and wonderful,
Caught it by the hilt, and brandished it
Three times, and then drew it under the mere.
The other returned lightly to the King.

Then King Arthur spoke, his breath growing heavier:
"Now, I see by your eyes that the deed is done.
Confess: what have you heard or seen?"

And answer made King Arthur, breathing hard:
"My end draws nigh; 'tis time that I were gone.
Make broad thy shoulders to receive my weight,
Anti bear me to the margin; yet I fear
My wound hath taken cold, and I shall die."
So saying, from the pavement he half rose,
Slowly, with pain, reclining on his arm,
And looking wistfully with wide blue eyes
As in a picture. Him Sir Bedivere
Remorsefully regarded thro’ his tears,
And would have spoken, but he found not words,
Then took with care, and kneeling on one knee,
O'er both his shoulders drew the languid hands,
And rising bore him thro' the place of tombs.
But, as he walk'd, King Arthur panted hard,
Like one that feels a nightmare on his bed
When all the house is mute. So sigh'd the King,
Muttering and murmuring at his ear "Quick, quick I
fear it is too late, and I shall die."
But the of her swiftly strode from ridge to ridge,
Clothed with his breath, and looking as he walk'd,
Larger than human on the frozen hills.
lie heard the deep behind him, and a cry
Before. His own thought drove him like a goad.
Dry clash'd his harness in the icy caves
And barren chasms, and all to left and right
The bare black cliff clang'd round him, as he based
His feet on juts of slippery crag that rang Sharp-
smitten with the dint, of armed heels—
And on a sudden, lo | the level lake,
And the long glories of the winter moon.

He caught the hilt and brandished it thrice before submerging it into the mere. Panting heavily, King Arthur responded, "My end is near; it's time for me to depart. Widen your shoulders to bear my weight, and carry me to the edge, but I fear the cold has entered my wound, and I might die." 

Half-rising from the pavement, he leaned onto his arm with difficulty, his deep, blue eyes displayed a wistful expression, similar to a painting. Sir Bedivere watched him remorsefully with tears in his eyes, wordless. He handled Arthur with care, drawing the king's limp hands over his shoulders. He rose to his feet, bearing the king through the tombstones. 

As they walked, King Arthur panted heavily, akin to someone experiencing a nightmare in a quiet house. The king sighed, whispering, "Hurry... I fear it might be too late, and I will die." 

As for the other, clothed in the king's breath, he swiftly moved from ridge to ridge, appearing more substantial than human against the backdrop of the frosty hills. Behind him, he could hear the depth, and a cry echoed ahead. His own thoughts prodded him onward.

His armor clashed dryly within the echo of icy caverns and barren crevices. To both his left and right, the stark black cliffs echoed his approach, his feet cautiously treading on precarious crags that echoed when struck by his armored heels. 

Suddenly, a level lake came into view, illuminated by the elongated glories of the winter moon.

SIR ROGER AT CHURCH

I ex always very well pleased with a country Sunday,
and think, if keeping holy the seventh day were only a
human institution, it would be the best method that
could have been thought of for the polishing and civiliz-
ing of mankind. It is certain the country people would
soon degenerate into a kind of savages and barbarians,
were there not such frequent returns of a stated time, in
which the whole village meet together with their best
faces, and in their cleanliest habits, to converse with one
another upon indifferent subjects, hear their duties ex-
plained to them, and join together in adoration of the
Supreme Being. Sunday clears away the rust of the
whole week, not only as it refreshes in their minds the
notions of religion, but as it puts both the sexes upon
appearing in their most agreeable forms, and exerting all
such qualities as are apt to give them a figure in the eye
of the village. A country fellow distinguishes himself as
much in the churchyard, as a citizen does upon the
Change, the whole parish-politics being generally dis-
cussed in that place either after sermon or before the
bell rings.

My friend Sir Roger, being a good churchman, has
beautified the inside of his church with several texts of his
own choosing. He has likewise given a handsome pulpit-
cloth, and railed in the communion table at his. own
expense. He has often told me, that at his coming to his

SIR ROGER AT CHURCH

I am always very satisfied with a country Sunday, and I believe if the sanctity of the seventh day were merely a human institution, it would still be the most effective method ever conceived for refining and civilizing mankind. I am certain that country folks would quickly decline into savagery and barbarism if there were not such regular recurrence of a set time during which the entire village gathers in their best attire to converse on various topics, listen to explanations of their duties, and unite in worship of the Supreme Being. Sunday removes the week's accumulated grime, not only by refreshing religious principles in their minds, but also by encouraging both genders to present themselves in the most appealing manner and display all the qualities likely to grant them status in the eyes of the village. A country fellow establishes his place as much in the churchyard as a citizen does at the Exchange; the entire parish's politics are usually deliberated there, either after the sermon or before the bell rings.

My friend Sir Roger, as a devout churchgoer, has enhanced the interior of his church with a number of texts of his own selection. He has also generously provided an attractive cloth for the pulpit and financed the installment of a railing around the communion table. He has often told me that upon his arrival at the church...

estate he found his parishioners very irregular; and that
in order to make them kneel and join in the responses, he
gave every one of them a hassock and a common-prayer
book: and at the same time employed an itinerant sing-
ing-master, who goes about the country for that purpose,
to instruct them rightly in the tunes of the psalms;
upon which they now very much value themselves, and
indeed outdo most of the country churches that I have
ever heard.

As Sir Roger is landlord to the whole congregation, he
keeps them in very good order, and will suffer nobody
to sleep in it besides himself; for if by chance he has
been surprised into a short nap at sermon, upon recover-
ing out of it he stands up and looks about him, and if he
sees anybody else nodding, either wakes them himself,
or sends his servants to them. Several other of the old
knight's peculiarities break out upon these occasions.
Sometimes he will be lengthening out a verse in the
singing psalms, half a minute after the rest of the congre-
gation have done with it; sometimes when lie is pleased
with the matter of his devotion, he pronounces amen
three or four times to the same prayer; and sometimes
stands up when everybody else is upon their knees, to
count the congregation, or see if any of his tenants are
missing.

I was yesterday very much surprised to hear my old
friend, in the midst of the service, calling out to one John
Matthews to mind what he was about, and not disturb
the congregation. This John Matthews it seems is re-
markable for being an idle, fellow, and at that time was
kicking his heels for his diversion. This authority of
the knight, though exerted in that odd manner which
accompanies him in all circumstances of life, has a very

Sir Roger at Church

Upon acquiring his estate, Sir Roger found that his parishioners were considerably irregular. To coax them into kneeling and joining in the responses, he provided each with a hassock and a common-prayer book. He also employed a wandering singing-master, who travels throughout the country for this purpose, to teach them the correct psalm tunes. His efforts have led the parish to take pride in their singing, which now surpasses most of the rural churches I have visited.

As the landlord of the entire congregation, Sir Roger maintains order attentively. He does not permit anyone to sleep during the sermon, except himself. Should he ever drift into a brief nap, he stands and looks around upon awakening. If he finds anyone else nodding off, he either wakes them himself or sends his servants to do so. Various other unique traits of the old knight become apparent on such occasions. For instance, he sometimes prolongs a verse in the singing psalms, continuing half a minute after the rest of the congregation has concluded. At times, when pleased with his prayer's essence, he repeats 'amen' three or four times. Occasionally, he stands while everyone else is on their knees, either to tally the congregation or to see if any of his tenants are absent.

Yesterday, I was taken aback when my old friend, in the midst of the service, shouted at one John Matthews to behave and not disturb the rest of the congregation. This John Matthews, it seems, is known for being idle and at that moment was amusing himself by kicking his heels. Despite the unconventional manner of Sir Roger's authority, which is consistent in all his life circumstances, it has a significant impact.

In that era, the ability to write verses in Latin was essential for success. Consequently, Addison ascended to the position of Secretary of State. He also composed much poetry in English, which, with the exception of one or two hymns often sung in churches, has mostly been forgotten. However, Addison’s lasting fame lies in his role as an essayist. His essays, specifically those from The Spectator, enjoyed a wide circulation and secured his popularity.

Children dear, was it yesterday

We heard the sweet bells over the bay?
In the caverns where we lay,

Through the surf and through the swell,
The far-off sound of a silver bell?
Sand-strewn caverns, cool and deep,
Where the winds are all asleep;

Where the spent lights quiver and gleam;
Where the salt weed sways in the stream;
Where the sea-beasts ranged all round
Feed in the ooze of their pasture ground;
Where the sea-snakes coil and twine,
Dry their mail and bask in the brine;
Where great whales come sailing by,
Sail and sail, with unshut eye,

Round the world for ever and aye?
When did music come this way?

(Call yet once) that she went away?

Once she sate with you and me,

On a red gold throne in the heart of the sea,

And the youngest sate on her knee.

When down swung the sound of the far-off bell.

In the caves where we took shelter,

Amidst the crashing surf and swelling waves,
We detected the distant sound of a silver bell.
We found solace in sand-strewn caverns, cool and deep,
Where the winds slumber;

Where the exhausted lights flicker and shimmer;
Where the salt weed undulates in the stream;
Where the sea creatures roam freely,
Feeding in the slimy bed of their feeding grounds;
Where the sea snakes coil and intertwine,
Drying their scales and basking in the salty brine;
Where the great whales pass,
Sailing ceaselessly, their eyes forever open,

Circling the globe eternally.
When did music grace such a place? 
Dear children, was it only yesterday?

My dear children, was it yesterday

(Invoke once more) that she departed?

She once sat with you and me,

On a throne of red gold in the heart of the sea,

And the youngest of you sat on her lap.

She gently combed its hair, caring for it diligently,
When suddenly, the distant bell's echo descended.

She sighed and looked up through the translucent green sea.

And anon there breaks a sigh,

And anon there drops a tear,

And a heart sorrow-laden,

A long, long sigh,

For the cold strange eyes of a little Mermaiden,
And the gleam of her golden hair.

Come away, away, children.

Her eyes fixated in an empty stare;

Suddenly, a sigh escapes her,

Then, a tear quietly falls,

From an eye masked by sorrow,

And a heart heavy with pain,

A melancholic sigh,

Longing for the unfamiliar gentle gaze of a little mermaid,
And the sheen of her golden hair.

Rise, children, rise.
Come down, children, descend.
The harsh wind turns chillier;
Lights flicker on in the town.

She will awaken from her slumber
When gusts rattle the door;

A DISSERTATION UPON ROAST PIG

MANKIND, says a Chinese manuscript, for the first
seventy thousand ages ate their meat raw, clawing or
biting it, from the living animal, just as they do in
Abyssinia to this day. The manuscript goes on to say,
that the art of roasting, or rather broiling (which I take
to be the elder brother), was accidentally discovered in
the manner following. The swineherd, Ho-ti, having
gone out into the woods one morning, as his manner
was, to collect mast for his hogs, left his cottage in the
care of his eldest son Bo-bo, a great lubberly boy, who
being fond of playing with fire, as younkers of his age
commonly are, let some sparks escape into a bundle of
straw, which, kindling quickly, spread the conflagration
over every part of their poor mansion, till it was reduced
to ashes. Together with the cottage (a sorry antediluvian
makeshift of a building, you may think it), what was of
much more importance, a fine litter of new-farrowed
pigs, no less than nine in number, perished. China pigs
have been esteemed a luxury all over the East from the
remotest periods that we read of. Bo-bo was in utmost
consternation, as you may think, not so much for the
sake of the tenement, which his father and he could
easily build up again with a few dry branches, and the
labour of an hour or two, at any time, as for the loss of
the pigs. While he was thinking what he should say to
his father, and wringing his hands over the smoking

A Dissertation on Roast Pig

A Chinese manuscript suggests that for the first seventy-thousand years, mankind consumed meat raw, directly from the living animal, a practice that is still carried out in modern-day Abyssinia. The manuscript further explains the accidental discovery of roasting, or perhaps, broiling, which it considers a more ancient method. 

The tale is characterized by a swineherd named Ho-ti, who, one morning, ventured into the woods, as he often did, to gather mast for his hogs. He left his cottage in the care of his eldest son, Bo-bo, a rather large and clumsy boy, who, like many his age, had a fascination with fire. Bo-bo inadvertently let some sparks fly into a bundle of straw, causing a rapid fire that engulfed their humble abode until it was reduced to ashes.

Along with the loss of their cottage, which one might dismiss as a rudimentary structure, a more valuable asset was destroyed - a litter of newborn pigs, totalling nine, all perished in the fire. Chinese pigs have been regarded as a luxury in all of eastern culture since the earliest known times. Understandably, Bo-bo was filled with the utmost fear and regret, not so much for the loss of their house, which he and his father could easily reconstruct using a few dry branches and a couple hours of labor, but rather for the loss of the pigs. He was left wondering what he could possibly say to his father, distress evident as he wrung his hands over the remains.

remnants of one of those untimely sufferers, an odour
assailed his nostrils, unlike any scent which he had before
experienced. What could it proceed from?—not from
the burnt cottage—he had smelt that smell before—
indeed this was by no means the first accident of the
kind which had occurred through the negligence of this
unlucky young fire-brand. Much less did it resemble that
of any known herb, weed, or flower. A premonitory
moistening at the same time overflowed his nether lip.
He knew not what to think. He next stooped down to
feel the pig, if there were any signs of life in it. He burnt
his fingers, and to cool them he applied them in his booby
fashion to his mouth. Some of the crumbs of the scorched
skin had come away with his fingers, and for the first
time in his life (in the world's life indeed, for before him
no man had known it) he tasted—crackling! Again he
felt and fumbled at the pig. It did not burn him so much
now, still he licked his fingers from a sort of habit. The
truth at length broke into his slow understanding, that
it was the pig that smelt so, and the pig that tasted so
delicious; and, surrendering himself up to the newborn
pleasure, he fell to tearing up whole handfuls of the
scorched skin with the flesh next it, and was cramming
it down his throat in his beastly fashion, when his sire
entered amid the smoking rafters, armed with retribu-
tory cudgel, and finding how affairs stood, began to rain
blows upon the young rogue's shoulders, as thick as
hailstones, which 130-bo heeded not any more than if
they had been flies. The tickling pleasure which he
experienced in his lower regions had rendered him quite
callous to any inconveniences he might feel in those
remote quarters. His father might lay on, but he could
not beat him from his pig, till he had fairly made an end

102 EXTRACTS AND EXERCISES

The remnants of an unfortunate victim emitted an odor unlike anything he had ever experienced. The scent was not reminiscent of the burnt cottage, a smell he had encountered before. This was not the first time such an incident had occurred because of this careless, young arsonist. The aroma was also unlike any known herb, weed, or flower. Simultaneously, his bottom lip became moist with anticipation. He was puzzled, unsure of what to make of it. He bent down to check the pig for signs of life. When he burnt his fingers, instinctively, he applied them to his mouth in a silly fashion. Doing so, he realized, some of the scorched skin had transferred onto his fingers. For the first time in his life - in fact, in human history because no one before had known of this - he tasted crackling. He proceeded to explore the pig again. It didn't burn as intensely as before, but out of habit, he licked his fingers. Slowly, the truth began to register - the pig was responsible for the tantalizing smell and delicious flavor. Embracing this newfound pleasure, he started ripping off large portions of the charred skin with the flesh beneath, shoving them into his mouth in a unrefined manner. During this, his father entered, through the smoky remnants of the house, armed with a cudgel. Upon seeing the situation, he began to punish his son with a barrage of blows. Despite the amount and intensity of the hits, comparable to a hailstorm, the boy ignored them as if they were nothing more than minor annoyances. The incredible pleasure he derived from consuming the roasted pig made him quite indifferent to any discomfort his father's punishment might have caused. His father might continue punishing him, but nothing could separate him from his pig until he had savored every bit of it.

of it, when, becoming a little more sensible of his situa-
tion, something like the following dialogue ensued.

"You graceless whelp, what have you got there devour-
ing? Is it not enough that you have burnt me down three
houses with your dog's tricks, and be hanged to you, but
you must be eating fire, and I know not what--what
have you got there, I say ?"

"0, father, the pig, the pig, do come and taste how
nice the burnt pig cats."

The ears of Ho-ti tingled with horror. He cursed his
son, and he cursed himself that ever he should beget a
son that should eat burnt pig.

Bo-bo, whose scent was wonderfully sharpened since
morning, soon raked out another pig and fairly rending
it asunder, thrust the lesser half by main force into the
fists of Ho-ti, still shouting out "Eat, cat, eat the burnt
pig, father, only taste-0 Lord,"—with such-like bar-
barous ejaculations, cramming all the while as if he
would choke.

Ho-ti trembled in every joint while he grasped the
abominable thing, wavering whether he should not put
his son to death for an unnatural young monster, when
the crackling scorched his lingers, as it had done his son's,
and applying the same remedy to them, he in his turn
tasted some of its flavour, which, make what sour mouths
he would for a pretence, proved not altogether displeas-
ing to him. In conclusion (for the manuscript here is a
little tedious) both father and son fairly sat down to the
mess, and never left off till they had despatched all that
remained of the litter.

Bo-bo was strictly enjoined not to let the secret escape,
for the neighbours would certainly have stoned them for
a couple of abominable wretches, who could think of im-

In this context, a semblance of dialogue occurred once he had somewhat comprehended his predicament.

"You unrestrained scamp, what are you consuming there?" he queried, exasperated. "Was it not enough that you destroyed three of my houses with your reckless pranks, leaving me curse-riddled, but now you're feasting on fire and goodness knows what else. What is it that you're eating, I demand to know?"

"Oh, father, it's the pig, the pig! Do come and experience how delicious the charred pig tastes," he replied enthusiastically.

The ears of Ho-ti filled with dread at the mention. He condemned his son, and reproached himself for ever siring a son who consumed burnt pig.

Bo-bo, whose sense of smell was remarkably heightened since the morning, quickly excavated another pig and, after ruthlessly dividing it, forced the smaller section into the hands of Ho-ti, vehemently encouraging, "Eat, father, eat the charred pig. Just taste it, oh Lord," while voicing such uncivilized exclamations. All the while, he consumed it hastily as if he would suffocate.

Ho-ti trembled from head to toe as he held the detestable substance, contemplating whether he should condemn his son to death as a horrifying young beast. However, when the sizzling meat scorched his fingers as it had his son's, and he applied the identical remedy to them, he cautiously sampled its taste. Regardless of his feigned distaste, he found it not entirely displeasing. In conclusion (for the manuscript here becomes somewhat verbose), both father and son finally sat down to the meal and continued until they had polished off the remaining portions of the litter.

Bo-bo was strictly instructed not to let this secret slip, for their neighbors would undoubtedly have castigated them, viewing them as loathsome beings capable of such barbaric indulgence.

proving upon the good meat which God had sent them.
Nevertheless, strange stories got about. It was observed
that Ho-ti's cottage was burnt down now more frequently
than ever. Nothing but fires from this time forward.
Some would break out in broad day, others in the night-
time. As often as the sow farrowed, so sure was the house
of IIo-ti to be in a blaze; and Ho-ti himself, which was
the more remarkable, instead of chastising his son,
seemed to grow more indulgent to him than ever. At
length they were watched, the terrible mystery dis-
covered, and father and son summoned to take their trial
at PeIdn, then an inconsiderable assize town, Evidence
was given, the obnoxioixs food itself produced in court,
and verdict about to be pronounced, when the foreman
of the jury begged that some of the burnt pig, of which
the culprits stood accused, might be handed into the box.
He handled it, and they all handled it, and burning their
fingers, as Bo-bo and his father had done before them,
and nature prompting to each of them the same remedy,
against the face of all the facts, and the clearest charge
which judge had ever given,—to the surprise of the whole
court, townsfolk, strangers, reporters, and all present—
without leaving the box, or any manner of consultation
whatever, they brought in a simultaneous verdict of Not
Guilty.

The judge, who was a shrewd fellow, winked at the
manifest iniquity of the decision; and when the court
was dismissed, went privily, and bought up all the pigs
that could be had for love or money. In a few days his
Lordship's town house was observed to be on fire. The
thing took wing, and now there was nothing to be seen
but fires in every direction. Fuel and pigs grew enor-
mously dear all over the district. The insurance offices

Feasting on the savory meat God had gifted them, Ho-ti and his son continued to invite speculations. Stories were whispered that the frequency of fires at Ho-ti's abode had noticeably increased. Whether day time or night, the fires ensued incessantly. A peculiar pattern emerged where the occurrence of fires at Ho-ti's house coincided with each of the sow's farrow. Curiously, rather than reprimanding his son, Ho-ti grew more accepting of him. 

Eventually, onlookers began to scrutinize their activities, leading to the revelation of their peculiar secret. Both father and son were commanded to stand trial at Peldn, a small, fairly insignificant town known for its assizes. Court proceedings began and evidence was presented, most notably the suspiciously prepared food was on display in court. Right before the verdict was announced, the presiding juror requested a sampling of the controversial pig meat with which the pair stood accused. 

All the jurors inspected it, burning their fingers, much like Bo-bo and Ho-ti had before them. Nature seemed to guide them all towards the same balm. Despite the mountain of evidence and the steadfast argument from the judge, the entire jury, to the astonishment of the court, locals, strangers, reporters, and all in attendance, declared the verdict impromptu. Without leaving the box or convening, they unanimously pronounced the pair Not Guilty.

The sharp-minded judge, recognizing the indisputable injustice of the verdict, kept his counsel. Once the court was dismissed, he discretely purchased all available pigs. Within days, a fire was sighted at his townhouse. That incident instigated an outbreak and soon fires were visible from every direction. The surge in demand for fuel and pigs caused prices to skyrocket throughout the region. The insurance offices, too, felt this escalade.

called it) without the necessity of consuming a whole
house to dress it. Then first began the rude form of a

DISSERTATION ON ROAST PIG 105

Every day, constructions were becoming increasingly precarious, leading to a fear that the science of architecture would soon be lost to the world. This practice of burning houses persisted until, over time, a thoughtful sage discovered that the flesh of swine, or indeed any other animal, could be cooked, or "burnt" as they referred to it, without needing to burn an entire house in the process. This sparked the rudimentary beginnings of a cooking tool - the gridiron. The technique of roasting by string, or a spit, came in a century or two later; I can't recall during whose dynasty this innovation materialized. The manuscript concludes that even the most useful, and seemingly evident disciplines, penetrate human society in such slow increments. 

Despite the slightly incredulous nature of the narrative, it can be agreed that, if there were a noteworthy justification for such a potentially catastrophic experiment as incinerating houses, this justification could be found in the culinary delight that is roast pig. CHARLES LAMB

This quickly ignited, leading to a large blaze that reduced their humble home to ashes, along with a fine litter of newborn piglets. This was a grave loss. Distraught and apprehensive about what to tell his father, Bo-bo was stricken by a peculiar smell. This scent was unfamiliar to him, clearly not from the burnt cottage, something he had experienced before. Recalling past accidents caused by his carelessness that generated this smell, his mouth started to water. As he touched the pig, he burnt his fingers.

For a laggard in love, and a coward in war,
Was to wed the fair Ellen of brave Lochinvar.

So boldly he entered the Netherby Hall,

Among bride's-men, and kinsmen, and brothers, and all:
Then spoke the bride's father, his hand on his sword,
(For the poor craven bridegroom said never a word),
"O come ye in peace here, or come ye in war,

Or to dance at our bridal, young Lord Lochinvar?"

"I long wooed your daughter, my suit you denied;—
Love swells like the Solway, but ebbs like its tide—
And now am I come, with this lost love of mine,

To lead but one measure, drink one cup of wine.
There are maidens in Scotland more lovely by far,
That would gladly be bride to the young Lochinvar."

The bride kissed the goblet: the knight took it up,
He quaffed off the wine, and he threw down the cup.
She looked down to blush, and she looked up to sigh,
With a smile on her lips, and a tear in her eye.

He took her soft hand, ere her mother could bar,--
"Now tread we a measure I" said young Lochinvar.

So stately his form, and so lovely her face,

Thai never a hall such a galliard did grace;

While her mother did fret, and her father did fume,
And the bridegroom stood dangling his bonnet and plume;
And the bride-maidens whispered, " "Twere better by far,
To have matched our fair cousin with young Lochinvar."

One touch to her hand, and one word in her car,

When they reached the hall-door, and the charger stood
near;

So light to the croupe the fair lady he swung,

So light to the saddle before her he sprung I

Boldly, he entered Netherby Hall,
Among bride's men, kinsmen, brothers and all.
The bride's father spoke, his hand on his sword,
(For the timid bridegroom uttered not a word),
"Do you come in peace or do you come in war,
Or to dance at our bridal, young Lord Lochinvar?"

"I wooed your daughter long, but you refused my suit—
Love swells like the Solway but ebbs like its tide—
And now I've come, with this lost love of mine,
To lead just one dance, drink just one cup of wine.
There are maidens in Scotland far more lovely by far,
Who would joyfully be a bride to young Lochinvar."

The bride kissed the goblet; the knight picked it up,
He drank down the wine, and then threw down the cup.
She looked down to blush, and looked up to sigh,
With a smile on her lips, and a tear in her eye.

Before her mother could intervene, he took her soft hand,
"We shall dance now," said young Lochinvar, so grand.

His form was so stately, her face so roundly beautiful,
Never had such a galliard graced another hall so fully.
Her mother fretted, her father fumed,
The bridegroom stood idly, his bonnet and plume dismissed,
The bridesmaids whispered, "It would have been better by far,
To match our fair cousin with young Lochinvar."

With one touch to her hand, and one word in her ear,
When they reached the hall door, the charger stood near.
The fair lady he swung so lightly to the croupe,
So easily to the saddle before her he sprung.

Lightly lilting a gay love-song

Singing a gay love-song lightly,

There fell a spark on the upland grass—
The dry Bush leapt into flame;—

And I felt my heart go cold as death,

But I heard him name Her name.

Down the hill-side the fire-floods rushed.
On the roaring eastern wind;—Neck

the bay mare kept her pace,
But the grey horse dropped behind.

He turned in the saddle—"Let's change, I say!"
And his bridle rein he drew.

No words to waste that day!—Swift

bay mare from Dandenong,—
And Bannerman rode the grey.

The hot air scorched like a furnace blast
From the very mouth of Hell:-
The blue gums caught and blazed on high
Like flaming pillars into the sky;...
The grey horse staggered and fell.

"Ride, ride, lad—tride for her sake!" he cried;
Into the gulf of flame
Were swept, in less than a breathing space,
The laughing eyes, and the comely face,
And the lins that named Her name.

DOBBIN'S FIGHT WITH CUFF

Cum's fight with Dobbin, and the unexpected issue of
that contest, will long be remembered by every man who
was educated at Dr Swishtail's famous school. The latter
youth (who used to be called Heigh-ho Dobbin, Gee-ho
Dobbin, and by many other names indicative of puerile
contempt) was the quietest, the clumsiest, and, as it
seemed, the dullest of all Dr Swishtail's young gentlemen.
His parent was a grocer in the City: and it was bruited
abroad that he was admitted into Dr Swishtail's academy
upon what are called "mutual principles "—that is to
say, the expenses of his board and schooling were de-
frayed by his father in goods, not money; and he stood

it-almost at the bottom of the school—in his scraggy
corduroys and jacket, through the seams of which his
great big bones were bursting—as the representative of
so many pounds of tea, candles, sugar, mottled-soap,
plums (of which a very mild proportion was supplied
for the puddings of the establishment), and other
commodities. A dreadful day it was for young Dobbin
when one of the youngsters of the school, having run into
the town upon a poaching excursion for hardbake and
polonies, espied the cart of Dobbin and Budge, Grocers
and Oilmen, Thames Street, London, at the Doctor's
door, discharging a cargo of the wares in which the firm
dealt.

Chapter XI
Dobbin's Battle with Cuff

The extraordinary outcome of the skirmish between Cuff and Dobbin will long be remembered by every scholar educated at Dr. Swishtail's esteemed school. Dobbin, the latter and young boy, was often taunted with nicknames like Heigh-ho Dobbin, Gee-ho Dobbin - a testament to his peers' juvenile disdain. He was among the gentlest, most awkward, and seemingly slowest of Dr. Swishtail's students. His father was a city grocer, and rumors circulated that Dobbin was admitted into Dr. Swishtail's academy on "mutual principles". In other words, his father paid his tuition and boarding expenses in kind, not in cash.

Dressed in worn-out corduroy trousers and jackets which seemed too small for his large bones, Dobbin served as a tangible representation of the groceries his father provided. These items included tea, candles, sugar, mottled soap, and a modest amount of plums used for the school's puddings, among other goods. A dreadful day came for young Dobbin when one of his schoolmates, on a town trip for sweets and sausages, spotted Dobbin and Budge's grocery cart, from Thames Street, London, outside the Doctor's door, offloading products sold by the duo.

Young Dobbin had no peace after that. The jokes were
frightful, and merciless against him. "Hullo, Dobbin,"
one wag would say, "here's good news in the paper. Sugar
is ris'; my boy." Another would set a sum—" If a pound
of mutton-candles cost sevenpence-halfpenny, how much
must Dobbin cost ?" and a roar would follow from all the
circle of young knaves, usher and all, who 'rightly con-
sidered that the selling of goods by retail is a shameful
and infamous practice, meriting the contempt and scorn
of all real gentlemen.

"Your father's only a merchant, Osborne," Dobbin
said in private to the little boy who had brought down
the storm upon him. At which the latter replied
haughtily, "My father's a gentleman, and keeps his
carriage," and Mr William Dobbin retreated to a remote
outhouse in the playground, where he passed a half-
holiday in the bitterest sadness and woe.

Now, William Dobbin, from an incapacity to acquire
the rudiments of the Latin language, as they are pro-
pounded in that wonderful book the Eton Latin
Grammar, was compelled to remain among the very last
of Dr Swishtail's scholars, and was "taken down"
continually by little fellows with pink faces and pinafores
when he marched up with the lower form, a giant
amongst them, with downcast stupefied look, his dog's-
eared primer, and his tight corduroys. High and low, all
made fun of him. They sewed up those corduroys, tight
as they were. They cut his bed-strings. They upset
buckets and benches, so that he might break his shins
over them, which he never failed to do. They sent him
parcels, which, when opened, were found to contain the
paternal soap and candles. There was no little fellow
but had his ieer and ioke at Dobbin: and he bore everv-

After that incident, young Dobbin had no peace. The jokes made at his expense were harsh, relentless and merciless. "Hey, Dobbin," one would jeer, "there's good news in the paper. The price of sugar has increased, my boy." Another would propose a mock arithmetic problem. "If a pound of mutton candles costs seven and a half pence, how much would Dobbin cost?" A burst of laughter would follow from the group of young ruffians, including the school usher who believed that retail selling of goods was a disgraceful practice, deserving the disdain and scorn of all true gentlemen.

"Your father is merely a merchant, Osborne," Dobbin privately told the boy responsible for his recent humiliation, to which the boy retorted arrogantly, "My father is a gentleman and owns a carriage." Stricken, Mr. William Dobbin retreated to a secluded outhouse in the schoolyard, where he spent a half-day holiday in profound sadness and desolation.

William Dobbin, unable to grasp the basic principles of the Latin language as presented in the acclaimed Eton Latin Grammar book, found himself at the bottom of Dr. Swishtail's class. Little boys, all fresh-faced and donned in pinafores, frequently outperformed him. He stood out among them - a tall figure with a dejected face, tightly worn corduroys and a well-thumbed primer - when he trudged up with the lower form. Classmates of all ranks poked fun at him. They sewed up his corduroys even tighter. They snipped his bed strings. They upset buckets and benches so he would trip over them, which he invariably did. They sent him packages filled with his own soap and candles. No one was too small to taunt or mock Dobbin, and he bore it all silently.

thing quite patiently, and was entirely dumb and
miserable.

Cuff, on the contrary, was the great chief and dandy
of the Swishtail Seminary. He smuggled wine in. He
fought the town-boys. Ponies used to come for him to
ride home on Saturdays. He had his top-boots in his
room, in which ho used to hunt in the holidays. He had
a gold repeater: and he took snuff like the Doctor. He
had been to the Opera, and knew the merits of the princi-
pal actors, preferring Mr Kean to Mr Kemble. He could
knock you off forty Latin verses in an hour. He could
make French poetry. What else didn't he know, or
couldn't he do ? They said even the Doctor himself was
afraid of him.

Cuff, the unquestioned king of the school, ruled over
his subjects, and bullied them, with splendid superiority.
This one blacked his shoes : that toasted his bread,
others would fag out, and give him balls at cricket during
whole summer afternoons. 'Figs ' was the fellow whom

Dobbin's Fight with Cuff 119

Dobbin, on one hand, persevered through everything quite patiently. He was completely mute and miserable.

On the other hand, Cuff was the unmistakable leader and dandy of Swishtail Seminary. He would smuggle in wine and battle against the local boys. Every Saturday, ponies were sent for him to ride home. He kept his high boots in his room, which he used for hunting on holidays. He owned a gold pocket watch and took snuff just like the Doctor. Cuff had been to the Opera and formed opinions on the primary actors, favoring Mr. Kean over Mr. Kemble. He could produce forty lines of Latin poetry in an hour, and he could write in French. What was it that he did not know or could not do? It was said even the Doctor himself feared him.

Cuff, as the uncontested king of the school, dominated over his peers, bullying them with majestic superiority. Some shined his shoes while others toasted his bread. Many would labor and offer him the ball during cricket matches that last whole afternoons in summer. 'Figs' was the boy he scorned the most, and despite constant mockery and sneering, he barely ever stooped to have direct contact with him.

One day in private, the two young men had a disagreement. Figs, alone in the schoolroom, struggled over a letter when Cuff suddenly entered, demanding him to run an errand most likely related to tarts.

"I can't," said Dobbin, "I want to finish my letter."

"You can't!" retorted Mr. Cuff. He seized the document that was scarred with crossed-out words and misspellings, and had undoubtedly consumed much of Dobbin's thought, effort, and tears.

was writing to his mother, who was fond of him, although
she was a grocer's wife, and lived in a back parlour in
Thames Street). "You can't?" says Mr Cuff: "I should
like to know why, pray? Can't you write to old Mother
Figs to-morrow ?"

"Don't call names," Dobbin said, getting off the bench
very nervous.

"Well, sir, will you go ?" crowed the cock of the
school.

"Put down that letter," Dobbin replied; "no gentle-
man readth lettefth."

"Well, now will you go ?" says the other.

"No, I won't. Don't strike, or I'll thnzash you," roars
out Dobbin, springing to a leaden inkstand, and looking
so wicked, that Mr Cuff paused, turned down his coat
sleeves again, put his hands into his pockets, and walked
away with a sneer. But he never meddled personally
with the grocer's boy after that; though we must do
him the justice to say he always spoke of Mr Dobbin with
contempt behind his back.

Some time after this interview, it happened that Mr
Cuff, on a sunshiny afternoon, was in the neighbourhood
of poor William Dobbin, who was lying under a tree in
the playground, spelling over a favourite copy of The
Arabian Nights which he had—apart from the rest of the
school, who were pursuing their various sports—dquite
lonely, and almost happy.

William Dobbin had for once forgotten the world, and
was away with Sinbad the Sailor in the Valley of
Diamonds, or with Prince Ahmed and the Fairy Peri-
banou in that delightful cavern where the Prince found
her, and whither we should all like to make a tour; when
shrill cries, as of a little fellow weeping, woke up his

He was writing to his mother, who held deep affection for him despite being a humble grocer's wife residing in a small back parlor on Thames Street. "You can't?" Mr. Cuff queried, "May I know the reason why? Can't you write to old Mother Figs tomorrow?"

"Let's refrain from name-calling," Dobbin chided, stepping down from the bench with noticeable nervousness.

"So, will you go?" The school's ruffian taunted.

"Put down that letter," Dobbin retorted; "no gentleman reads others' letters."

"And now, are you leaving?" the ruffian persisted.

"No, I'm not. Don't strike, or I'll thrash you!" Dobbin warned, grasping a hefty inkstand, his menacing look causing Mr. Cuff to withdraw. He rolled down his sleeves, stuffed his hands into his pockets, and strolled away with an air of disdain. From that day forward, he never directly bothered the grocer's son, although he frequently uttered disrespectful remarks about Mr. Dobbin behind his back.

Sometime after this encounter, Mr. Cuff found himself near a solitary William Dobbin on a sunny afternoon. Dobbin lay under a tree in the playground, engrossed in his favorite copy of 'The Arabian Nights'. He was detached from his schoolmates who carried on with their diverse games, leaving him alone and almost content.

For that moment, William Dobbin was in a world of his own, adventuring with Sinbad the Sailor in the Valley of Diamonds, or trailing Prince Ahmed and the Fairy Peribanou in the fascinating cavern. He was so engrossed in his fantasy that sharp cries, akin to a young boy weeping, startled him out of his reverie.

pleasant reverie; and looking up, he saw Cuff before him,
belabouring a little boy.

It was the lad who had peached upon him about the
grocer's cart; but he bore little malice, not at least
towards the young and small. "How dare you, sir, break
the bottle ?" says Cuff to the little urchin, swinging a
yellow cricket-stump over him.

The boy had been instructed to get over the play-
ground wall (at a selected spot where the broken glass
had been removed from the top, and niches made con-
venient in the brick); to run a quarter of a mile; to
purchase a pint of rum-shrub on credit; to brave all the
Doctor's outlying spies, and to clamber back into the
playground again; during the performance of which
feat, his foot had slipt, and the bottle was broken, and
the shrub had been spilt, and his pantaloons had
been damaged, and he appeared before his employer
a perfectly guilty and trembling, though harmless,
wretch.

"How dare you, sir, break it?" says Cuff; "you
blundering little thief. You drank the shrub, and now
you pretend to have broken the bottle. Hold out your
hand, sir."

Down came the stump with a great heavy thump on
the child's hand. A moan followed. Dobbin looked up.
The Fairy Peribanou had fled into the inmost cavern
with Prince Ahmed: the Roe had whisked away Sinbad
the Sailor out of the Valley of Diamonds out of sight, far
into the clouds: and there was everyday life before
honest William; and a big boy beating a little one
without cause.

"Hold out your other hand, sir," roars Cuff to his
little school-fellow, whose face was distorted with pain.

CHAPTER 121: DOBBIN'S CONFRONTATION WITH CUFF

In his pleasant daydream, Dobbin snapped back to reality to see Cuff lavishing blows on a small boy.

This was the boy who had betrayed Dobbin about the grocer's cart. Despite this, Dobbin harbored little resentment, particularly towards the younger or smaller ones. "How dare you, sir, break the bottle?" Cuff challenged the little youngster, brandishing a yellow cricket stump over him.

Guiding instructions had led the boy to scale the playground wall where the harmful broken glass had been previously cleared off, easing his climb. His task involved running a quarter of a mile, purchasing a pint of rum shrub on credit, evading the school doctor's peripheral watchmen, and then scrambling back into the playground. During his daring venture, he'd slipped, broken the bottle and spilled the shrub on his clothes. Consequently, he appeared before Cuff as a purely culpable, trembling but harmless culprit.

"How dare you, sir, break it?" Cuff scolded, "You clumsy little thief. You swallowed the shrub, and now you feign to have broken the bottle. Extend your hand, sir."

With a swift movement, the cricket stump came down hard on the child's hand, drawing out a moan from the boy. Dobbin lifted his gaze. The Fairy Peribanou had sought refuge in the deepest cavern with Prince Ahmed and Sinbad the Sailor had been carried by the Roe far beyond the reach of the Valley of Diamonds, disappearing into the clouds. Before Dobbin, instead of his daydreams, was the raw scene of the bigger boy assaulting the smaller one without justification.

"Extend your other hand, sir," Cuff commanded his little school-fellow, who was visibly in pain.

"Take that, you little rascal!" cried Mr Cuff, and
down came the wicket again on the child's hand.
Dobbin started up.

I can't tell what his motive was. Up he sprang, and
screamed out, "Hold off, Cuff, don't bully that child any
more; or I'l]—"

"Or you'll what?" Cuff asked in amazement at this
interruption. "Hold out your hand, you little beast."

"T'll give you the worst thrashing you ever had in
your life," Dobbin said, in reply to the first part of Cuff's
sentence; and little Osborne, gasping and in tears, looked
up with wonder and incredulity at seeing this amazing
champion put up suddenly to defend him : while Cuff's
astonishment was hardly less. Fancy our late monarch
George III when he heard of the revolt of the North
American Colonies : fancy brazen Goliath when little
David stepped forward and claimed a meeting; and you
have the feelings of Mr Reginald Cuff when this rencontre
was proposed to him.

"After school," says he, of course; after a pause and
a look, as much as to say, "Make your will, and communi-
cate your last wishes to your friends between this time
and that."

"As you please," Dobbin said. "You must be my
bottle-holder, Osborne."

"Well, if you like," littlhe Osborne replied; for you see
his papa kept a carriage, and he was rather ashamed of
his champion.

Yes, when the hour of battle came, he was almost
ashamed to say, "Go it, Figs "; and not a single other

Dobbin trembled, pulling his old, narrow clothes tighter around him.

"Take that, you little rascal!" Mr. Cuff shouted, bringing down the wicket once again on the child's hand. Dobbin hastily stood up.

His motive was unclear. Regardless, he sprang up and shouted, "Hold it right there, Cuff. Stop bullying that child, or I'll--"

"Or you'll do what?" Cuff asked, astounded by this interruption. "Hold out your hand, you little beast."

"I'll give you the worst thrashing you've ever had," Dobbin countered, addressing Cuff's prior statement. Little Osborne, catching his breath between sobs, looked up in disbelief as he witnessed this bold champion stand up to defend him. Cuff's surprise was equally notable. Imagine King George III's shock when he learned of the North American Colonies' rebellion or Goliath's astonishment when little David challenged him. This accurately reflects Mr. Reginald Cuff's sentiment when this unexpected encounter was presented to him.

"After school," Cuff managed after a pause, his gaze piercing as if he was saying, "Use the time wisely to finalize your will and convey your final wishes to your loved ones."

"As you wish," Dobbin responded. "You'll have to be my backup, Osborne."

"Well, if you insist," little Osborne retorted, somewhat embarrassed - his father did maintain a carriage, and he felt a twinge of shame for his protector.

Yes, when the hour of the battle arrived, he almost hesitated to cheer, "Go it, Figs", and no one else did either.

DOBBIN'S FIGHT WITH CUFF 128

boy in the place uttered that cry for the first two or three
rounds of that famous combat, at the commencement of
which the scientific Cuff, with a contemptuous smile on
his face, and as light and as gay as if he was at a ball,
planted his blows upon his adversary, and floored that
unlucky champion three times running. At each fall
there was a. cheer; and everybody was anxious to have
the honour of offering the conqueror a knee.

"What a licking I shall get when it's over," young
Osborne thought, picking up his man. "You'd best give
in," he said to Dobbin; "it's only a thrashing, Figs, and
you know I'm used to it." But Figs, all whose limbs
were in a quiver, and whose nostrils were breathing rage,
put his little bottle-Holder aside, and went in for a
fourth time.

As he did not in the least know how to parry the blows
that were aimed at himself, and Cuff had begun the
attack on the three preceding occasions, without ever
allowing his enemy to strike, Figs now determined that
he would commence the engagement by a charge on his
own part; and accordingly, being a left-handed man,
brought that arm into action, and hit out a couple of
times with all his might—once at Mr Cuff's left eye, and
once on his. beautiful Roman nose.

Cuff went down this time, to the astonishment of the
assembly. "Well hit, by Jove," says little Osborne,
with the air of a connoisseur, clapping his man on the
back. "Give it him with the left, Figs, my boy."

Figs' left made terrific play during the rest of the
combat. Cuff went down every time. At the sixth
round, there were almost as many fellows shouting out,
"Go it, Figs," as there were youths exclaiming, "Go it,
Cuffs." At the twelfth round the latter champion was

"Dobbin's Fight with Cuff: Scene 128"

Every boy in the vicinity was screaming in excitement during the first two or three rounds of that memorable fight. The highly skilled Cuff began the clash with a dismissive smile on his face, light and carefree as if attending a ball. He swiftly landed his blows on his opponent, knocking the unfortunate champion to the ground three times in a row. Each fall was met with rousing cheers, and everyone eagerly sought the honor of providing a knee for the victorious Cuff.

As he helped his combatant rise, young Osborne couldn't help but consider the formidable thrashing awaiting him. Turning to Dobbin, he said, "You may as well give in, it's just a beating, Figs, and I've taken plenty." However, Dobbin, trembling in anticipation and breathing heavily with anger, disregarded the well-intended advice and prepared for a fourth round.

Unsure how to defend against incoming blows, and having seen Cuff commence the attack without giving him a chance to strike back on each preceding occasion, Dobbin decided to spearhead the next round himself. Being left-handed, he leveraged this advantage, throwing a few powerful punches. His target: the somewhat smug Mr. Cuff's left eye and his admirably Romanesque nose.

The unexpected punch sent Cuff crashing to the ground, to the utter surprise of the crowd. "Great punch, by Jove," exclaimed little Osborne, patting Dobbin on the back with an air of admiration, "Hit him with the left, Figs, my boy."

Dobbin's left hand continued to dominate the ensuing rounds of the fight. Each time, it was Cuff who fell. By the sixth round, shouts of "Go, Figs" almost matched the cries of "Go, Cuffs." By the twelfth round, it was blatantly clear who the crowd's new favorite champion was.

all abroad, as the saying is, and had lost all presence of
mind and power of attack or defence. Figs, on the con-
trary, was as calm as a Quaker. His face being quite pale,
his eyes shining open, and a great cut on his under lip
bleeding profusely, gave this young fellow a fierce and
ghastly air, which perhaps struck terror into many
spectators. Nevertheless, his intrepid adversary pre-
pared to close for the thirteenth time. Cuff coming up
full of pluck, but quite reeling and groggy, the Fig-
merchant put in his left as usual on his adversary's
nose, and sent him down for the last time.

"T think that will do for him," Figs said, as his op-
ponent dropped as neatly on the green as I have seen
Jack Spot's ball plump into the pocket at billiards; and
the fact is, when time was called, Mr Reginald Cuff was
not able, or did not choose, to stand up again.

And now all the boys set up such a shout for Figs as
would have made you think he had been their darling
champion through the whole battle; and as absolutely
brought Dr Swishtail out of his study, curious to know
the cause of the uproar. He threatened to flog Figs
violently, of course; but Cuff, who had come to himself
by this time, and was washing his wounds, stood up and
said, "It's my fault, sir—not Figs'—not Dobbin's. I was
bullying a little boy; and he served me right." By
which magnanimous speech he not only saved his
conqueror a whipping, but got back all his ascendency
over the boys which his defeat had nearly cost him.

Completely disoriented, he had lost all composure and ability to attack or defend himself. Contrarily, Figs remained as calm as a Quaker. His pale face, wide shining eyes, and a significant cut on his lower lip that bled profusely, gave this young man an intimidating and ghastly appearance, which perhaps struck fear into many spectators. Yet, his brave adversary prepared to approach for the thirteenth time. Cuff was full of courage but seemed unsteady and dazed. The Fig merchant delivered his typical left hit on his adversary's nose, knocking him down one last time.

"I think that will do for him," Figs commented, as his competitor dropped as smoothly onto the green turf as I've seen Jack Spot's ball descend into the pocket in a game of billiards. In fact, when time was called, Mr. Reginald Cuff was either unable or unwilling to rise again.

Now, all the boys exulted for Figs with such a colossal roar that one might have thought he had been their esteemed champion throughout the whole battle. Their noise summoned Dr. Swishtail from his study, curious about the cause of the uproar. He threatened to punish Figs severely, of course. However, Cuff, who had regained his senses at this point and was tending to his injuries, stood up and proclaimed, "It's my fault, sir—not Figs'—not Dobbin's. I was bullying a little boy, and he served me right." With this noble declaration, he not only saved his conqueror a punishment but also regained all the influence over the boys which his defeat had nearly cost him.

weeping, woke up his pleasant reverie; and looking up, he

ELEGY WRITTEN IN A COUNTRY
CHURCHYARD

TEE curfew tolls the knell of parting day,

The lowing herd wind slowly o'er the lea,

The ploughman homeward plods his weary way,
And leaves the world to darkness and to me.

Now fades the glimmering landscape on the sight,
And all the air a solemn stillness holds,

Save where the beetle wheels his droning flight,
And drowsy tinklings lull the distant folds :

Save that from yonder ivy-mantled tower
The moping owl does to the moon complain
Of such as, wandering near her secret bower,
Molest her ancient solitary reign.

Beneath those rugged elms, that yew-tree's shade
%Mere heaves the turf in many a mouldering heap,
Each in his narrow cell for ever laid,

The rude forefathers of the hamlet sleep.

The breezy call of incense-breathing morn,

The swallow twittering from the straw-built shed,
The cock's shrill clarion, or the echoing horn,
No more shall rouse them from their lowly bed.

Or busy housewife ply her evening care :

No children run to lisp their sire's return,

Or climb his knees the envied kiss to share.

Oft did the harvest to their sickle yield,

Their furrow oft the stubborn glebe has broke;

How jocund did they drive their team afield!

How how'd the woods beneath their sturdy stroke!

Let not Ambition mock their useful toil,
Their homely joys, and destiny obscure;
Nor Grandeur hear with a disdainful smile
The short and simple annals of the poor.

The boast of heraldry, the pomp of power,
And all that beauty, all that wealth e'er gave
Await alike th'inevitable hour;

The paths of glory lead but to the grave.

Nor you, ye proud, impute to these the fault,

If Memory o'er their tomb no trophies raise,

Where through the long-drawn aisle and fretted vault
The pealing anthem swells the note of praise.

Can storied urn or animated bust

Back to its mansion call the fleeting breath?
Can Honour's voice provoke the silent dust,
Or Flatt'ry soothe the dull cold car of Death?

Perhaps in this neglected spot is laid

Some heart once pregnant with celestial fire;
Hands, that the rod of empire might have sway'd,
Or waked to ecstasy the living lyre;

Often the harvest surrendered to their sickle,

Many times they broke the obstinate soil with their plow;
Filled with joy, they managed their team in the field!
How powerful was their strike in the quiet woods!

Let not Ambition scorn their useful labor,
Their humble joys, and obscure fate;
Nor let Grandeur dismiss with a disdainful smile
The short and simple chronicles of the poor.

The pride of ancestry, the show of power,
And all that beauty, all that wealth could give,
Awaits the same inevitable hour;

The paths of glory lead only to the grave.

Nor you, the proud, attribute to them the fault,

If Memory raises no trophies above their tomb

Where through the grand aisle and decorative vault,

The pealing anthem amplifies its note of praise.

Can a decorated urn or lifelike bust

Revive the fleeting breath to its dwelling?
Can the voice of Honour stir the silent dust,
Or can Flattery pacify the dull, cold grasp of Death?

Perhaps in this neglected spot is laid

A heart once radiant with celestial fire;
Hands, that might have wielded the rod of empire,
Or played to ecstasy the vibrant lyre.

Gray's Elegy & On a Favourite Cat 135

(i) The weary ploughman plods slowly homeward. 

(ii) The moping owl complains to the moon that her ancient, solitary reign has been disturbed. 

(iii) Nothing will rouse them from their lowly bed. They have departed beyond recall. 

(iv) Due to their poverty and ceaseless toil, the ample page of knowledge was never unrolled before their eyes. 

(v) A frail memorial has been erected by someone who wished to protect these bones from disrespect. 

(vi) I found his absence near his favourite tree. He had died. 

While Thomas Gray was staying with his mother and aunts at Stoke Poges, he began writing the famous elegy. For a time, it was not printed, but circulated among his friends in manuscript form. Later, it was published in a pamphlet and sold for sixpence. Unlike Old Thack, who was forced to write for a living due to circumstances, Gray didn't write much and he had a private income. He lived in a college in Cambridge but developed a severe fear of fire. To escape in case of emergency, he ordered a rope ladder from London. When the undergraduates learned of Gray's fear and his ladder, they falsely alarmed him of a fire. Expecting the worst, Gray descended his ladder quickly, landing in a bucket of cold water which had been placed beneath him. Gray failed to see the humor in the prank and angrily moved to another college, where ironically, he nearly had a legitimate fire emergency.
 
The Choice of Words

Create a list including the adjectives and their corresponding nouns from the lines "Now fades the glimmering landscape..." to "No more shall rouse them from their lowly bed." Note how each description is aptly fitting. Any word replacement would potentially lose its effect on sound or meaning.

CHAPTER XV
MARK TAPLEY AT SEA

It was a dark and dreary night; people were nestled in their beds or seated late before the fire. Despair, colder than Charity, was shivering at the street corners, and the church towers hummed faintly with their own vibrations, silent after resounding with the ghostly preaching, "One." The earth seemed shrouded by a dark pall as if mourning the day just passed. Dark clusters of trees, like solemn funeral feathers, waved mournfully in quiet repose, all hushed, all still. 

The only sounds breaking the stillness were the swift clouds that skimmed across the moon and the steady wind that trailed behind, pausing as if to listen, and then rustling onward, pausing again, and trailing behind in imitation of a predator stalking its prey. Where were these clouds and wind hastening to so eagerly? Were they, like guilty spirits, rushing to a dreadful meeting with a mighty force akin to themselves? In which wild regions would these ghostly elements hold council or indulge in fearsome play? 

Incessantly on, over the infinite expanse of turbulent space, rolled the thunderous waves. Once-solid mountains and caves were now indistinguishable, what once was one distinct form morphed into another, creating a seething maelstrom of boiling water. There was a constant movement, retreat, and the fierce return of wave after wave, culminating in a foaming spray that steeped the black night. 

There was a relentless shifting of place and time, a lack of consistency in anything but eternal discord; on and on they rolled, and as they moved, the night grew darker, the wind howled louder, and the clamor and fury intensified.

become the million voices in the sea, when the wild cry
goes forth upon the storm, "A ship |"

Onward she comes, in gallant combat with the elements,
her tall masts trembling, and her timbers starting on the
strain ; onward she comes, now high upon the curling
billows, now low down in the hollows of the sea as hiding
for the moment from its fury; and every storm-voice in
the air and water, cries more loudly yet, "A ship!"

And though the eager multitude crowd thick and fast
upon her all the night, and dawn of day discovers the
untiring train yet bearing down upon the ship in an
eternity of troubled water, onward she comes, with dim
lights burning in her hull, and people there, asleep: as
if no deadly element were peering in at every seam and
chink, and no drowned seaman's grave, with but a plank
to cover it, were yawning in the unfathomable depths
below.

Among these sleeping voyagers were Martin and Mark
Tapley, who, rocked into a heavy drowsiness by the un-
accustomed motion, were as insensible to the foul air in
which they lay, as to the uproar without. It was broad
day, when the latter awoke with a dim idea that he was
dreaming of having gone to sleep in a four-post bedstead
which had turned bottom upwards in the course of the
night. There was more reason in this too, than in the
roasting of eggs; for the first objects Mr Tapley recog-
nised when he opened his eyes were his own heels—
looking down at him, as he afterwards observed, from
a nearly perpendicular elevation.

"Well!" said Mark, getting himself into a sitting
posture, after various ineffectual struggles with the roll-
ing of the ship. "This is the first time as I ever stood on
my head all night."

188 Excerpts and Exercises 

Like a million voices in the sea, a wild cry goes out upon the storm, "A ship!" The ship gallantly combats the elements, her tall masts trembling and her timbers creaking under the strain. She rides high upon the curling billows, then dips low, momentarily hiding in the hollows of the sea to escape its fury. Each storm-driven voice in the air and water amplifies the cry, "A ship!"

The eager multitude continues to crowd around her throughout the night. Dawn reveals an untiring throng still bearing down upon the ship amidst turbulent waters. Yet, she presses onward. Her dim lights burn within her hull, its occupants asleep, seemingly oblivious to the deadly elements peering in through every seam and crevice. Beneath her, the unfathomable depths yawn open, representing a drowned sailor's grave with just a plank as its cover. 

Among the sleeping passengers are Martin and Mark Tapley. Lulled into a heavy slumber by the unfamiliar motion, they remain insensible to the foul air in their quarters and the turmoil outside. Mark awakens in broad daylight with the vague impression of having fallen asleep in a four-poster bed that has somehow turned upside down. His confused state seems less absurd than the thought of roasting eggs; the first things he recognizes upon opening his eyes are his own heels, peering down at him from a near-vertical height. 

"Well," Mark says, maneuvering himself into a sitting position after numerous failed attempts to counterbalance the rolling ship, "This is the first time I've ever spent the night standing on my head."

"You shouldn't go to sleep on the ground with your
head to leeward, then," growled a man in one of the
berths.

"With my head to where?" asked Mark. The man
repeated his previous sentiment.

"No, I won't another time," said Mark, "when I know
whereabouts on the map that country is. In the mean-
while I can give you a better piece of advice. Don't you
nor any other friend of mine never go to sleep with his
head in a ship, any more."

The man gave a grunt of discontented acquiescence,
turned over in his berth, and drew his blanket over his
head.

"__For," said Mr Tapley, pursuing the theme by way
of soliloquy, in a low tone of voice; "the sea is as non-
sensical a thing as any going. It never knows what to do
with itself. It hasn't got no employment for its mind,
and is always in a state of vacancy. Like them Polar
bears in the wild-beast shows as is constantly a-nodding
their heads from side to side, it never can be quiet.
Which is entirely owing to its uncommon stupidity."

"It's as much of me as is left, sir, after a fortnight of

"You shouldn't sleep on the ground with your head to leeward," a man in one of the berths growled.

"With my head to where?" Mark asked. The man repeated his earlier statement.

"I won't do that next time," Mark said, "once I know where on the map that location is. In the meantime, I can offer you a sounder piece of advice. Neither you nor any other friend of mine should go to sleep with your heads in a ship, anymore."

The man gave a gruff sound of discontented agreement, turned in his berth, and pulled his blanket over his head.

"For," Mr. Tapley continued, speaking more to himself in a low voice, "the sea is as capricious a thing as any. It never knows what to do with itself. Having no focus for its energy, it remains in a perpetual state of aimlessness. Like those polar bears in wildlife shows that are always nodding their heads from side to side, it can never be still. This behaviour is simply a reflection of its extraordinary lack of sense."

"Is that you, Mark?" asked a faint voice from another bunk.

"There's not much left of me after a fortnight of this work," Mr. Tapley replied. "Ever since I boarded this ship, I've led the life of a fly, constantly grasping something or the other, often in a topsy-turvy state. Coupled with this, I've exerted a lot of effort while also losing substantial energy to various tasks. As a result, there's barely enough of me left to vouch for. How do you feel this morning, sir?"

"Very miserable," Martin groaned peevishly. "Ugh! This is truly wretched!"

"Creditable," muttered Mark, pressing one hand upon
his aching head and looking round him with a rueful
grin. "That's the great comfort. It is creditable to
keep up one's spirits here. Virtue's its own reward. So's
jollity."

Mark was so far right, that unquestionably any man
who retained his cheerfulness among the steerage ac-
commodations of that noble and fast sailing line of
packet-ship, The Screw, was solely indebted to his own
resources, and shipped his good humour, like his pro-
visions, without any contribution or assistance from the
owners. A dark, low, stifling cabin, surrounded by
berths all filled to overflowing with men, women, and
children, in various stages of sickness and misery, is not
the liveliest place of assembly at any time; but when
it is so crowded that mattresses and beds are heaped
upon the floor, to the extinction of everything like
comfort, cleanliness, and decency, it is liable to operate
not only as a pretty strong barrier against amiability of
temper, but as a positive encourager of selfish and rough
humours. Mark felt this, as he sat looking about him;
and his spirits rose proportionately.

Here an old grandmother was crooning over a sick
child, and rocking it to and fro, in arms hardly more
wasted than its own young limbs; here a poor woman
With an infant in her lap, mended another little creature's
clothes, and quieted another who was creeping up about
her from their scanty bed upon the floor. Here were old
men awkwardly engaged in little household offices,

fellows--giants in their way—doing such little acts of
tenderness for those about them, as might have belonged

"Creditable," Mark muttered, pressing a hand to his throbbing head. He scanned his surroundings with a wry smile. "That's the great comfort. Keeping up one's spirits here is commendable. Virtue is its own reward, as is jollity."

Mark was correct in his perceptions. Any man able to maintain cheerfulness amidst the steerage accommodations of the noble and fast-sailing packet-ship, The Screw, owed his bright spirits solely to his own inner resources. He held onto his good humour, much like his provisions, without any help or contribution from the ship's owners. 

The unpleasantness of the dark, cramped, stuffy cabin, filled with men, women, and children in various stages of discomfort and sickness, hardly made it a place for jovial gatherings. The overcrowding was such that mattresses were heaped on the floor, obliterating all semblance of comfort, cleanliness, and decency. It risked promoting not just hard tempers, but also selfish and crude behaviours. Mark keenly felt these conditions, and his spirits lifted in defiance.

Nearby, an old grandmother was softly singing while rocking a sick child back and forth in her arms, which were barely more emaciated than the child's frail limbs. A poor woman, cradling an infant, simultaneously repaired a little one's clothes and soothed another child who was emerging from their sparse bedding on the floor. Some old men were involved in small domestic chores, in which they would have appeared ridiculous if not for their good intentions. Swarthy men, seeming like giants among them, were performing minor acts of kindness for those around them, acts they might have been considered unsuited for in a different context.

to gentlest-hearted dwarfs. The very idiot in the corner
who sat mowing there, all day, had his faculty of imita-
tion roused by what he saw about him; and snapped
his lingers; to amuse a crying child.

"Now, then," said Mark, nodding to a woman who
was dressing her three children at no great distance from
him: and the grin upon his face had by this time-spread
from ear to ear: "Hand over one of them young ‘uns
according to custom."

"I wish you'd get breakfast, Mark, instead of worrying
with people who don't belong to you," observed Martin,
petulantly.

"All right," said Mark. "She'll do that. It's a fair
diVision of labour, sir. I wash her boys, and she makes
our tea. I never cou/d make tea, but anyone can wash a
boy."

The woman, who was delicate and ill, felt and under-
stood his kindness, as well she might, for she had been
covered every night with his great-coat, while he had had
for his own bed the bare boards and a rug. But, Martin,
who seldom got up or looked about him, was quite
incensed at the folly of this speech, and expressed his
dissatisfaction by an impatient groan.

"So it is, certainly," said Mark, brushing the child's
hair as coolly as if he had been born and bred a barber.

"What are you talking about, now ?" asked Martin.

"What you said," replied Mark; "or what you meant,
when you gave that there dismal vent to your feelings.
I quite go along with it, sir. It is very hard upon her."

"What is?"

Even the gentlest-hearted dwarfs seemed affected, even the idiot sitting in the corner, who was mowing all day, seemed to find his faculty for imitation awakened by what he saw around him, and clicked his fingers to amuse a crying child.

"Now then," Mark addressed a woman in the near distance, who was dressing her three children. The grin on his face had expanded from ear to ear, "Hand over one of the youngsters according to custom."

"Mark, I wish you would prepare breakfast instead of meddling with people who aren't your concern," Martin remarked peevishly.

"All right," responded Mark. "She'll handle that. It's a fair distribution of work, sir. I wash her boys, and she brews our tea. I never could brew tea, but anyone can wash a boy."

The woman, who was frail and ill, appreciated his kindness. Indeed, she had the full reason to, for she had been covered with his overcoat every night, while he rested on nothing but bare boards and a rug. Martin, who rarely stirred or observed his surroundings, was quite vexed with Mark's absurd statements and expressed his displeasure with an impatient groan.

"Indeed, it is," replied Mark, brushing the child's hair with nonchalance as though it were his born profession.

"Now, what are you talking about?" Martin asked.

"I'm referring to what you said," replied Mark, "or what you insinuated when you let loose that gloomy sigh. I completely agree with you, sir. It is indeed very hard on her."

"What is?"

"The fact that she is making this voyage alone with these young obstacles here, and travelling this far at this time of the year to meet her husband. In case you'd rather not be...

driven mad with yellow soap in your eye, young man,"
said Mr Tapley to the second urchin, who was by this
time under his hands at the basin, " you'd better shutit."

"Where does she join her husband?" asked Martin,
yawning.

"Why, I'm very much afraid," said Mr Tapley, in a
low voice, "that she don't know. I hope she mayn't
miss him. But she sent her last letter by hand, and if
she don't see him a waving his pocket handkerchief on
the shore, like a pietur out of a song-book, my opinion
is, she'll break her heart."

"Why, how, in Folly's name, does the woman come to
be on board ship on such a wild-goose venture!" cried
Martin.

Mr Tapley glanced at him for a moment as he lay
prostrate in his berth, and then said very quietly:

" Ah I How, indeed! I can't think! He's been away
from her, for two year: she's been very poor and lonely
in her own country; and has always been looking
forward to meeting him. It's very strange she should be
here. Quite amazing! A little mad, perhaps! There
can't he no other way of accounting for it."

Martin was too far gone in the lassitude of sea-sickness
to make any reply to these words, or even to attend to
them as they were spoken. And the subject of their dis-
course returning at this crisis with some hot tea, effectu-
ally put a stop to any resumption of the theme by Mr
Tapley; who, when the meal was over and be had
adjusted Martin's bed, went up on deck to wash the
breakfast service, which consisted of two half-pint tin
mugs, and a shaving-pot of the same metal.

"Driven mad with yellow soap in your eye, young man," Mr. Tapley said to the second urchin, already under his hands at the basin, "you'd better close it."

"Where is she meeting her husband?" asked Martin, mid-yawn.

"There's a real possibility," said Mr. Tapley softly, "that she doesn't know. I have hopes she won't miss him. She delivered her last letter by hand. If she doesn't spot him waving his handkerchief on the shore like a scene from a romantic ballad, I believe it will break her heart."

"How on earth did this woman end up on board on such a baseless mission!" exclaimed Martin.

Mr. Tapley looked at Martin, who was sprawled in his berth, then very calmly replied:

"That's the question. I really can't figure it out. He's been away from her for two years. She's been poor and desolate in her own country, always anticipating their reunion. It's astonishing that she should be here. Quite perplexing! A touch of madness, perhaps! There's no other plausible explanation for it."

Martin was too consumed in the exhaustion of seasickness to adequately respond or pay attention to their conversation. Just as they were discussing, they were interrupted by the return of the woman in question with a cup of hot tea. This effectively ended any further discussion on the matter by Mr. Tapley. After the meal, once Martin's bed was in order, he went up on deck to wash the breakfast dishes, which consisted of two half-pint tin mugs and a shaving pot of the same material.

It's worth mentioning that Mark Tapley suffered from seasickness as much as any man or woman.

On board, there was a child who had a peculiar tendency to injure himself at the slightest provocation and lose his footing with every lurch of the ship. However, he resolved—in his usual phrase—to "come out strong" amidst difficult conditions. He was the life and soul of the steerage. He made no fuss about interrupting a humorous conversation to go and be excessively ill by himself. Then, he would return in the highest and most cheerful mood to continue it, as if such behavior was the most ordinary in the world. 

There was never a more popular character on board that grand, fast-sailing packet ship, The Screw, than Mark Tapley. He rose eventually to such a level of universal admiration that he started questioning if a man could rightfully garner praise for being cheerful under such stimulating conditions.

"If this was going to last," said Mr. Tapley, "I can't see a difference between The Screw and The Dragon. I somehow don’t ever manage to earn credit. I'm beginning to fear that fate is determined to make life easy for me."

"Oh, Mark," Martin groaned, near whose berth he had paused to converse. "When will this ordeal end?"

"Another week, they say, sir," returned Mark. "The ship’s moving along as well as any ship can, though that's not particularly high praise."

the after-cabin know just as much about him, as he
does about them, and are likely to trouble their heads
about him in the same proportion. I should have
thought that, certainly."

"IT tell you then," rejoined Martin, "you would have
thought wrong, and do think wrong."

" Very likely, sir," said Mark, with imperturbable good
temper. "I often do."

"As to lying here," cried Martin, raising himself on
his elbow, and looking angrily at his follower. "Do you
suppose it is a pleasure to lie here?"

"All the madhouses in the world," said Mr Tapley,
"couldn't produce such a maniac as the man must be
who could think that."

"Then why are you for ever goading and urging me
to get up?" asked Martin. "I lie here because I don't
wish to be recognised, in the better days to which I
aspire, by any purse-proud citizen, as the man who came
over with him among the steerage passengers. Die here,
because I wish to conceal my circumstances and myself,
and not to arrive in a new world Wedged and ticketed as
an utterly poverty-stricken man. If I could have afforded
a passage in the after-cabin, I should have held up my
head with the rest. As I couldn't, I hide it. Do you
understand that?"

Here, Mark listened to the words, "mingling with the destitute crowd that's tightly packed away in this sordid place. No doubt, my situation would greatly improve from that."

"I'm grateful that I don't know from personal experience what a gentleman's feelings might be," Mark said. "But I always thought, sir, that a gentleman would feel significantly more displeased down here than up in the fresh air. Particularly when the high class men and women in the after-cabin know just as much about him as he does about them and show a comparable lack of concern. That was certainly my presumption."

"Then let me tell you," retorted Martin, "You would have presumed incorrectly, and you still do."

"Very likely, sir," Mark responded, unfazed. "I often make mistakes."

"As to lying here," Martin interjected, raising himself on his elbow and glaring defiantly at his comrade. "Do you suppose I derive pleasure from lying here?"

"Not all the asylums in the world," Mr. Tapley said, "could yield such a lunatic as the man who could think that."

"Then why do you continually provoke and push me to get up?" Martin questioned. "I lie here because I don't want to be recognized, in the better days I hope for, by any wealthy individual as the man who traveled over as a steerage passenger. I hide here, concealing my circumstances and my identity, so as not enter a new world branded and labelled as an utterly impoverished man. If I could have afforded passage in the after-cabin, I would have held my head high with the others. But as I couldn't, I keep it low. Do you comprehend that?"

MARK TAPLEY AT SEA 145

"I am very sorry, sir," said Mark, "I didn't know you
took it so much to heart as Ibis comes to."

"Of course you didn't know," returned his master.
"How should you know, unless I told you? It's no trial
to you, Mark, to make yourself comfortable and to bustle
about. It's as natural for you to do so under the circum-
stances as it is for me not to do so. Why, you don't
suppose there's a living creature in this ship who can
possibly have half so much to undergo on board of her as

have? Do you ?" he asked, sitting upright in his
berth and looking at Mark, with an expression of great
earnestness not unmixed with wonder.

Mark twisted his face into a tight knot, and with his
head very much on one side pondered upon this question
as if he felt it an extremely difficult one to answer. He
was relieved from his embarrassment by Martin himself,
who said, as he stretched himself upon his back again
and resumed the book he had been reading:

"But what's the use of my putting such a case to you,
when the very essence of what I have been saying, is,
that you cannot by possibility understand it! Make me

"I am very sorry, sir," said Mark, "I was unaware that you took this situation to heart as much as you do."

"Of course, you didn't know," replied his master. "How could you know unless I told you? It's not a challenge for you, Mark, to make yourself comfortable and to stay busy. It's as natural for you to do so under these circumstances as it is for me to refrain. Do you suppose there's anyone on this ship who could possibly endure half as much as I am aboard her?" he inquired, sitting upright in his bed and scrutinizing Mark with an earnest and somewhat puzzled expression. 

Mark contorted his face and tilted his head to one side, pondering this question as though he found it tremendously difficult to answer. His discomfort was eased by Martin himself, who stretching back onto his bunk and picking up the book he had been reading, said, 

"But what's the point of posing such a question to you, when the crux of what I'm saying is that you couldn't possibly understand it! Prepare a little brandy-and-water for me, cold and very weak, and give me a biscuit. Also, tell your friend, our close neighbor, to try and keep her children a bit quieter tonight than they were last night. That would be appreciated."

Mr. Tapley set about these tasks swiftly, and it can be inferred from his lively actions that his spirits were revived. He even observed to himself a few times, under his breath, that in terms of imparting enthusiasm, The Screw (presumed to be a ship) certainly had some clear benefits over The Dragon (presumably another ship). He also remarked to himself that it was a high gratification.

"Courage," he said, and pointed toward the land.
"This mounting wave will soon roll us shoreward."
In the afternoon, they came unto a land,

Which perhaps always seemed to be in the afternoon.

All around the coast, the languid air swooned,
Breathing like one entrapped in a tired dream.
Unequivocally, above the valley, stood the full-faced moon;

Like wisps of smoke trailing downwards, the narrow stream
Seemed to falter and pause along the cliff, before it tumbled down.

A land of streams? Some, like smoke drifting down,
Slowly fell behind veils of the finest lawn;

Scum, coursing through fluctuating lights and shadow, broke,
Rolling into a luminous sheet of foam below.

The glistening river flowed towards the sea
From the inner land: far off, three mountaintops,

Three peaks covered in aged snow,
Crowned and dampened with showery drops,
Climbing up the shadowy pines above the tangled copses.

The enchanted sunset lingered low,
Hidden in the western mountain clefts of the dale,
Low greenery and the yellow down,
Sheltering palms and many a winding vale,
And a slender galingale, all in sight now.

A land where all things always seem'd the same.
And round about the keel with faces pale,
Dark faces pale against that rosy flame,

The mild-eyed melancholy Lotos-eaters came.

Branches they bore of that enchanted stem,
.Laden with flower and fruit, whereof they gave
To each, but whoso did receive of them,

And taste, to him the gushing of the wave

Far far away did seem to mourn and rave

On alien shores; and if his fellow spake,

His voice was thin, as voices from the grave;

And deep-asleep he seem'd, yet all awake,

And music in his ears his beating heart did make.

They sat them down upon the yellow sand,
Between the sun and moon upon the shore;

And sweet it was to dream of Fatherland,

Of child, and wife, and slave; but evermore

Most weary seem'd the sea, weary the oar,
Weary the wandering fields of barren foam.

Then some one said, "We will return no more";
And all at once they sang, "Our island home

Is far beyond the wave; we will no longer roam."

In a land where all things always seemed the same,
And around the ship's keel with faces pale,
Dark faces looked pale against that rosy flame,

The gentle-eyed, melancholy Lotos-eaters came.

They bore branches of that enchanted stem,
Laden with flowers and fruit, which they offered to each.
However, whoever received and tasted them,

Would hear the mourning and raving of waves
Far away on alien shores. If his companion spoke,

His voice was thin, like voices from the grave;
He seemed deeply asleep, yet entirely awake,

And music resonated in his ears, setting his heart aflutter.

They sat down on the yellow sand,
Between the sun and the moon upon the shore;

Dreaming of the homeland was sweet,
Daydreaming of children, wives, and servants; but always

The sea seemed weariest, as did the oar,
And the wandering fields of barren foam.

Then someone said, "We shall return no more";
And all at once they sang, "Our island home

Is far beyond the wave; we shall roam no more."

In silence; ripen, fall and cease:

Eating the Lotos day by day,

To watch the crisping ripples on the beach,

And tender curving lines of creamy spray;

To lend our hearts and spirits wholly

To the influence of mild-minded melancholy;

To muse and brood and live again in memory,

With those old faces of our infancy

Heap'd over with a mound of grass,

Two handfuls of white dust, shut in an urn of brass.

Dear is the memory of our wedded lives,

And dear the last embraces of our wives

And their warm tears: but all bath suffer'd change;
For surely now our household hearths arc cold:
Our sons inherit us: our looks are strange:

And we should come like ghosts to trouble joy.

Or else the island princes over-bold

Have eat our substance, and the minstrel sings
Before them of the ten-years' war in Troy,

And our great deeds, as half-forgotten things.

Is there confusion in the little isle?

Let what is broken so remain.

The Gods are hard to reconcile:

Ms hard to settle order once again.

There is confusion worse than death,

Trouble on trouble, pain on pain,

Long labour unto aged breath,

Sore task to hearts worn out with many wars

And eyes grown dim with gazing on the pilot-stars.

And the tender, curved lines of creamy spray.

We surrender our hearts and spirits entirely,

To the influence of gentle melancholy.

We muse, brood, and relive our past in memory,

Seeing those familiar faces from our infancy,

Buried beneath a grassy mound,

With two handfuls of white dust sealed in a brass urn.

VI

The memory of our married lives is cherished,

And the final embrace from our wives are precious,

With their warm tears; but all have experienced change.

For now, our household hearths are cold,

Our sons have inherited our roles, our looks are foreign,

And we would appear as ghosts disrupting happiness.

Perhaps the overconfident princes on the island 

Have consumed our substance, while the minstrel sings

Before them, of the ten-year war in Troy,

And our great deeds are treated as half-forgotten things.

Is there confusion on the small island?

Let what is shattered remain thus.

The Gods are challenging to appease —

It's tough to restore order once again.

The confusion is worse than death,

Troubles and pains pile on,

Long labor is painful to aging breath,

A daunting task for hearts worn by many wars

And eyes dimmed from gazing at the navigator's stars.

THE LOTUS-EATERS

Far below, in the valleys, the clouds are lightly curled around their golden houses, girdled with the gleaming world. Smiling in secret, they look over wasted lands, blight and famine, plague, earthquakes, roaring depths and fiery sands. Amid the clanging fights, flaming towns, sinking ships and, praying hands, they manage to find solace.

Yet, they find music centered in a doleful song steaming upwards – a lamentation, an ancient tale reflecting a wrong. Although it seems like a tale of little meaning, the words are indeed potent. It's chanted from an ill-used race of men that till the soil, sow the seeds, and reap the harvest with enduring toil, storing yearly mere earnings of wheat, wine, and oil.

Until they perish and suffer - some, 'tis whispered, suffer endless anguish in hell, while others dwell in Elysian valleys, resting their weary limbs on beds of asphodel. Assuredly, slumber is sweeter than toil. The shore seems fair within the deep mid-ocean, amidst wind, wave, and oar. Rest, noble mariners, we will not wander anymore.

(©) PUNCTUATION

Rewrite the following, showing dearly which is poetry and
which prose by using quotation marks, and by setting out the
poetry in its proper verse-form:

If you read "The Lotos-Eaters" carefully, you will see that
Tennyson was able to paint beautiful pictures to please the
mind's eye, and at the same time to compose sweet music
to delight the ear, in a way that few other poets could equal.
You can hear the mighty billows heaving in we have had
enough of action, and of motion we, mll'd to starboard, roll'd
to larboard, when the surge was seething free. You can see the
water falling over the cliff into the depths below in the lines
and like a downward smoke, the slender stream along the cliff
to fall and pause and fall did seem. While if you read the
stanza beginning there is sweet music here that softer falls
than petals from blown roses on the grass, you feel yourself
being sweetly lulled to sleep.

(C) PUNCTUATION

Revise the following text, clearly distinguishing between poetry and prose by using quotation marks, and formatting the poetry in its appropriate verse form:

When you carefully read  "The Lotos-Eaters", it becomes apparent that Tennyson had a unique ability to conjure vivid imagery that delights the mind's eye, and to create beautiful rhythm and melody that pleases the ear, in a way that few other poets could match. 

His description of the roaring waves can be heard in the lines:

"We have had enough of action, and motion,
we, rolled to starboard, rolled to larboard, 
when the surge was seething free."

And the scene of water spilling over the cliff into the abyss below is depicted in: 

"And like a downward smoke, the slender stream 
along the cliff to fall and pause and fall did seem."

Whereas in the stanza beginning with:

"There is sweet music here that softer falls 
than petals from blown roses on the grass,"

you can feel yourself being gently lulled to sleep.

they turned to the left, and back to the starting-point once
more.

The Chorie Song in "The Lotos-Eaters" is arranged in this way.
The opening stanza, or strophe, describes the beauty of the Lotos-
land, while the second, or antistrophe, deals with the troubles and
wanderings which have vexed the mariners. The third returns to
sing of the wondrous country to which they have come, while the
fourth reverts to the sorrows beyond. One stanza, the strophe,
is a sigh of contentment; the next, the antistrophe, is a moan of
despair, until in the epode, the last stanza of all, the mariners
resolve that they will wander no more.

Read through the Choric Song carefully, noting the contrast
which this arrangement gives, then write out the strophe which
you think to be the most beautiful.

(B) ADDITIONAL EXERCISES

(i) Write a prose description: (a) of the Lotos-land, (6) of the
life of a mariner.

(ii) Give as many beautiful comparisons as you can remember
for sweet music which falls on the car ever so softly.

(iii) Smith and Robinson had a debate, Smith arguing that the

THE LOTOS-EATERS 157

They turned to the left, and then back to the starting point once more. 

"The Lotos-Eaters" features a unique arrangement, known as the Choric Song. The first stanza, or strophe, details the allure of the Lotos-land, while the second, known as the antistrophe, depicts the challenges and wanderings that have plagued the mariners. The third stanza revisits the description of the captivating country they have now reached, while the fourth again underscores their sorrows from beyond. The strophe is a breath of contentment, while the antistrophe resonates with despair. Ultimately, in the epode, the final stanza, the mariners resolve to cease their wandering. 

Examine the Choric Song meticulously, observing the stark contrast its structure provides. Subsequently, identify and record the strophe you think is the most breathtaking.

heroes, as Athamas his uncle ruled in Bceotia; and like
Athamas, he was an unhappy man. For he had a step-
brother named Pclias, of whom some said he was a
nymph's son, and there were dark and sad tales about
his birth. When he was a babe he was cast out on the
mountains, and a wild mare came by and kicked him.
But a shepherd passing found the baby, with its face all
blackened by the blow; and took him home, and called
him Pelias, because his face was bruised and black. And
he grew up fierce and lawless, and did many a dreadful
deed; and at last he drove out iEson his step-brother,
and then his own brother Neleus, and took the kingdom
to himself, and ruled over the rich Minuan heroes, in
Iolcos by the sea.

And &son, when he was driven out, went sadly away
out of the town, leading his little son by the hand; and
he said to himself, "I must hide the child in the moun-
tains; or relicts will surely kill him, because he is the heir."

So he went up from the sea across the valley, through
the vineyards and the olive groves, and across the
torrent of Anauros, towards Pelion the ancient mountain,
whose brows are white with snow.

He went up and up into the mountain, over marsh,
and crag, and down, till the boy was tired and footsore,
and A.son had to bear him in his arms, till he came to
the mouth of a lonely cave, at the foot of a mighty cliff.

Above the cliff the snow-wreaths hung, dripping and
cracking in the sun; but at its foot around the cave's
mouth grew all fair flowers and herbs, as if in a garden,
ranged in order, each sort by itself. There they grew gaily
in the sunshine, and the spray of the torrent from above;
while from the cave came the sound of music, and a
man's voice singing to the harp.

Heroes, such as Athamas, ruled in Boeotia, but like his uncle Athamas, he was an unfortunate man. He had a step-brother named Pelias whose birth was shrouded in mystery and sorrow. Some speculated that he was the son of a nymph; as an infant, he was abandoned on the mountains where a wild mare kicked him. A passing shepherd found the baby, his face bruised and darkened by the blow. He took the baby home, named him Pelias because of his blackened face. Growing up fierce and lawless, Pelias committed numerous dreadful deeds. He eventually usurped his step-brother Aeson, his own brother Neleus, and took over the kingdom. He ruled over the rich Minuan heroes in Iolcos by the sea. 

Aeson, on being exiled, sorrowfully left the town leading his young son by the hand. He resolved to hide his son in the mountains, fearing that the relatives would kill the boy, the rightful heir. He journeyed from the sea through valleys, vineyards, olive groves, and crossed the torrent of Anarous to reach the ancient mountain Pelion, known for its snow-capped peaks. 

He steadily ascended the mountain, traversing marshes, crags, and valleys until the boy grew tired and footsore. Aeson carried his son in his arms until they arrived at a secluded cave at the base of an impressive cliff. 

Above the cliff, snowdrifts hung, melting and cracking under the sun. However, at its base near the mouth of the cave, a variety of beautiful flowers and herbs grew as in a garden, arranged neatly by species. They flourished in the sun and the spray from the overhead torrent. From within the cave, the melodious sounds of music wafted out along with a man's voice singing to the harp.

Then £son put down the lad and whispered—

"Fear not, but go in, and whomsoever you shall find,
lay your hands upon his knees and say, 'In the name of
Zeus, the father of Gods and men, I am your guest from
this day forth."

Then the lad went in without trembling, for he too
was a hero's son; but when he was within, he stopped in
wonder to listen to that magic song.

And there he saw the singer lying upon bear-skins and
fragrant boughs: Cheiron, the ancient centaur, the wisest
of all things beneath the sky. Down to the waist he was
a man, but below he was a noble horse; his white hair
rolled down over his broad shoulders, and his white
beard over his broad brown chest; and his eyes were
wise and mild, and his forehead like a mountain-wall.

And in his hands he held a harp of gold, and struck it
with a golden key; and as he struck, he sang till his
eyes glittered, and filled all the cave with light.

And lie sang of the birth of Time, and of the heavens
and I he dancing stars; and of the ocean, and the ether,
and I he fire, and the shaping of the wondrous earth.
And he sang of the treasures of the hills, and the hidden
jewels of the mine, and the veins of fire and metal,
and the virtues of all healing herbs, and of the speech
or birds, and of prophecy, and of hidden things to
come.

Then he sang of health, and strength, and manhood,
and a valiant heart; and of music, and hunting, and
wrestling, and all the games which heroes love; and of
I ravel, and wars, and sieges, and a noble death in fight;

Jason and the Centaur 161

Then Jason placed the young boy down and gently whispered, "Do not be afraid. Go inside, and upon whomever you find there, lay your hands on his knees. Say, 'In the name of Zeus, the father of Gods and men, I am your guest from this day forth.'"

With admirable courage for his age, the boy entered, unafraid, for he too was a son of a hero. Once inside, he had to halt momentarily, captivated by the enchanting song.

Inside, he spotted the singer reclined on bear skins and fragrant boughs. It was Cheiron, the ancient centaur, reputed as the wisest of all beings beneath the sky. From the waist up, he was a man, while his lower half was that of a noble horse. His white hair cascaded over his broad shoulders and his white beard sprawled across his broad chest. His eyes were wise and gentle, his forehead imposing like a mountain wall.

In his hands, he held a golden harp, playing it with a golden key. He sang as he played, his eyes sparkling brightly, flooding the cave with a celestial brilliance.

His song told the tale of Time's birth, the heavens, and the dancing stars. He sang of the ocean, the ether, the fire, and the shaping of the miraculous earth. He sang of the treasures hidden within the hills, the precious gems concealed in the mines, the veins of fire and metal, the virtues of healing herbs, the language of birds, prophecies, and of the mysteries of the future.

He sang of health, strength, manhood, and the power of a brave heart. He sang of music, hunting, wrestling, and all the games beloved by heroes. He sang about travels, wars, sieges, and heroic deaths in battle. When he sang about peace, abundance, and the notion of justice throughout the land, the boy listened with rapt attention, utterly forgetting his purpose as he lost himself in the song.

And at the last old Cheiron was silent, and called the
lad with a soft voice.

And the lad ran trembling to him, and would have
laid his hands upon his knees; but Cheiron smiled, and
said, "Call hither your father iEson, for I know you, and
all that has befallen, and saw you both afar in the valley,
even before you left the town."

Then JEson came in sadly, and Cheiron asked him,
"Why earnest thou not thyself to me, 4Eson the

And :son said-

"I thought, Cheiron will pity the lad if he sees him
come alone; and I wished to try whether he was fearless,
and dare venture like a hero's son. But now I entreat
you by Father Zeus, let the boy be your guest till better
times, and train him among the sons of the heroes, that
he may avenge his father's hearse."

Then Cheiron smiled, and drew the lad to him, and
laid his hand upon his golden locks and said, "Arc you
afraid of my horse's hoofs, fair boy, or will you be my
pupil from this day?"

"I would gladly have horse's hoofs like you, if I could
sing such songs as yours."

And Cheiron laughed, and said, "Sit here by me till
sundown, when your playfellows will come home,. and
you shall learn like them to be a king, worthy to rule
over gallant men."

Then he turned to iEson, and said, " Go back in peace,
and bend before the storm like a prudent man. This boy

Finally, old Cheiron fell silent and called the boy with a soft voice. 

Trembling, the boy ran to him and tried to lay his hands on Cheiron's knees. However, Cheiron simply smiled and said, "Summon your father, AEson, for I recognize you and your circumstances. I spotted both of you in the valley, even before you left the town."

Then AEson came in, looking despondent. Cheiron asked him, "Why didn't you introduce yourself to me, AEson of the AEolids?"

AEson replied, "I thought that if you saw the boy come alone, you would show him pity. Furthermore, I wanted to test his fearlessness and his ability to venture forth like the son of a hero. But now, I beg you by Zeus, let the boy be your guest during these tough times. Train him among the sons of heroes so that he may avenge my death."

Cheiron smiled and drew the boy towards him. Placing his hand upon the boy's golden locks, he asked, "Are you afraid of my horse's hoofs, young lad, or will you be my pupil from today?"

"I would proudly bear horse's hoofs like yours if it meant I could sing such beautiful songs as you do," the boy replied.

Laughing, Cheiron said, "Sit here beside me until sunset when your peers will return. Like them, you will learn to become a king worthy of ruling over gallant men."

He then addressed AEson, saying, "Go in peace and be prudent amidst adversity. This boy will not cross the Anauros again until he has come to bring glory to you and to the house of Aeolus."

AEson shed tears over his son and departed, but the boy didn't cry, captivated as he was by these strange occurrences.

whom he was to see.

Then Cheiron put the lyre into his hands, and taught
him how to play it, till the sun sank low behind the cliff,
and a shout was heard outside.

Then in came the sons of the heroes, JEneas, and
Heracles, and Peleus, and many another mighty name.

And great Cheiron leapt up joyfully, and his hoofs
made the cave resound, as they shouted, "Come out
Father Cheiron; come out and see our game." And one
cried, "I have killed two deer "; and another, "I took
a wild cat among the crags "; and Heracles dragged a
wild goat after him by its horns, for he was as huge as
a mountain crag; and Czeneus carried a bear-cub under
each arm, and laughed when they scratched and bit, for
neither tooth nor steel could wound him.

And Cheiron praised them all, each according to his
deserts.

Only one walked apart and silent, Asklepios, the too-
wise child, with his bosom full of herbs and flowers, and
round his wrist a spotted snake; he came with downcast
eyes to Cheiron, and whispered how he had watched the
snake cast its old skin, and grow young again before his
eyes, and how he had gone down into a village in the vale,.
and cured a dying man with a herb which he had seen
a sick goat eat.

Chapter 168: Jason and the Centaur

In the heart of the cave, Jason found companionship with the centaur and the joy of music that resonated within these stone walls. He also looked forward to meeting the friends he had yet to encounter.

Cheiron, the grand centaur, proceeded to place the lyre in Jason's hands, guiding him through the complex artistry of playing until the sun began to dip behind the cliffs. Their serene interlude was soon interrupted by echoing shouts from the exterior of the cave.

Momentarily, the sons of the heroes barreled in, each donning a name as mighty as their forebear- The types of legends, including Aeneas, Heracles, and Peleus. Cheiron couldn't contain his joy at their arrival, his hoofs resounding off the cave walls as he greeted them enthusiastically.

Each young hero began to boast: "I've slain two deer!", "I nabbed a wild cat along the crags!." Meanwhile, Heracles was dragging along a wild goat by the horns, his stature as commanding as a towering crag. Then, Czeneus casually strolled in, holding a bear cub under each arm, laughing off their feeble attempts to scratch and bite him, for no tooth nor steel could wound him.

Cheiron took turns praising them all according to their accomplishments, leaving no one unacknowledged. However, one among them, Asklepios, the unusually wise child, kept his distance. He hung by the sidelines, hugging a bundle of herbs and flowers to his chest. Around his wrist was a spotted snake. With downcast eyes, he approach Cheiron to reveal the events of his day. He had observed a snake shedding its old skin, rejuvenating. In a village, he had seen a sick goat consume a particular herb, which he then gave to a dying villager and cured him.

Cheiron, while he smiled, noted that though Athene and Apollo bequeath gifts upon each individual, and each is deserving in their own rights; Asklepios had been granted an honor surpassing all - He is bestowed the ability to cure, a striking contrast to his peers' capacity to kill.

Following this, the boys busied themselves with gathering and splitting firewood, kindling a robust fire. Others began preparing the game they'd caught– skinning and dressing the deer before setting it to roast on the fire.
